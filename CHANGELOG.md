## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Bundled Git & Bash on Windows (fresh-laptop support).** Windows installers now embed a pinned `desktop/dugite-native` build (git 2.53.0 + a POSIX shell) so the agent works on a clean Windows machine without Git for Windows installed. A new tri-state `windowsGitSource` config key (`"auto"` default / `"host"` / `"bundled"`) selects the source: `auto` prefers host git+bash when both are on PATH, else falls back to the bundle atomically. The bundled tree is downloaded + SHA-256-verified at build time (`download-git-windows.mjs`, GO/NO-GO in `bundle-server.mjs`), PATH-augmented for every spawned session and terminal PTY (`ensureBundledGitOnPath`, hooked into `ToolResolver.buildSpawnEnv` + terminal-manager), surfaced in Settings (Windows-only "Git & Bash source" selector + live readout), Diagnostics (`git source` / `bash source` rows + Switch-to-host/bundled buttons), `/api/health` (`gitSource` block), and the Electron About dialog (GPLv2 license link). No-op on macOS/Linux (both ship git + `/bin/sh`); installers there are unchanged. dugite-native ships `usr/bin/sh.exe` (GNU bash) rather than `bash.exe`, which matches pi's `pi.exec("sh")` bang-command path; git libdir is arch-specific (`mingw64` on x64, `clangarm64` on arm64). R1 risk verified on real `windows-latest` + `windows-11-arm` CI runners. (change: `embed-git-bash-on-windows`)
- **Mid-stream message badges.** When a user message arrives while the agent is streaming (pi 0.77+ `InputEvent.streamingBehavior`), the transcript now stamps an inline badge on the user bubble: "steered" (interrupted the current turn) or "queued" (delivered after the current turn). Idle inputs and non-interactive sources (`rpc` / `extension`) show no badge. The reducer correlates the interactive `input` event with the next user `message_start` to attach the delivery mode. (change: `surface-input-streaming-behavior`)
- **Linkified tool output.** Bash, generic-tool, and other plain-text tool result blocks now detect URLs and file references (`path:line[:col]` and bare paths with recognised code/document extensions). URLs open in a new tab with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. File references open in the detected editor on localhost (reuses existing `/api/open-editor` plumbing) or in a read-only in-dashboard preview overlay on remote / mobile / no-editor-detected. Conservative tier-1 detection avoids false positives on prose like `version 1.0.0` / `and/or` / `math.PI`. Selection and copy are preserved verbatim across link boundaries. Tokenisation is memoised per result string with a 5000-link overflow cap. (change: `linkify-tool-output`)
- **Adopt `providers.json#roles` ownership from pi-flows.** The dashboard extension now owns the `roles`, `rolePresets`, and `activePreset` sections of `~/.pi/agent/providers.json` and registers the `flow:role-set` / `flow:role-get-all` / `flow:role-preset-*` event handlers that back Settings → Roles. The `model:resolve` event listener (formalized here) handles `@role`, `provider/model[:thinking]`, and bare `model-id` refs with a cooperative early-return idiom shared across the pi extension ecosystem. The legacy `flow:resolve-model` listener remains as a deprecated one-release alias. Requires pi-flows ≥ the version shipping companion change `consume-model-resolve-event` for full standalone behavior; until then both packages register the same listeners safely (atomic tmp+rename writes, last writer wins). (change: `adopt-model-resolve-handler-and-roles-ownership`)
- **Release-time test + smoke gate.** `publish.yml` gains a `release-gate` aggregate (`ci-checks` + `smoke` fanned out in parallel after `resolve`) that MUST pass before `tag-and-push` writes a commit/tag and before `publish` uploads to npm. On `workflow_dispatch` a failing gate aborts cleanly — no commit, no tag, no artifact. The smoke matrix moved out of `ci.yml` (no longer runs on PRs) into the reusable `_smoke.yml`, with a new `ci-smoke.yml` workflow_dispatch entry for on-demand per-branch validation. Repo-lint `publish-workflow-contract.test.ts` extended with 5-clause gate contract. (change: `gate-publish-on-smoke-and-tests`)

### Changed
- **Windows: restored Setup.exe installer; dropped portable.exe.** Windows ships a per-user NSIS `Setup.exe` (`PI-Dashboard-Setup-<version>-<arch>.exe`, x64 + arm64) built on the CI `windows-latest` legs via `electron-builder --win nsis`. The wizard lets the user choose the install directory (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PI Dashboard\`), creates a Start Menu shortcut, registers an Add/Remove Programs entry under HKCU, and installs an uninstaller that removes the app but preserves `~/.pi/` and `~/.pi-dashboard/`. The installer is per-user only (no admin, no per-machine mode). The broken 7-Zip SFX `portable.exe` target is removed — use Setup.exe (installer) or the `.zip` (extract-and-run). The `.zip` artifacts are unchanged. (change: `restore-windows-nsis-installer`)
- **Pi compatibility floor lifted to 0.78.0 (recommended 0.78.0).** Supersedes the unshipped `bump-pi-compat-to-0-76` proposal. Tracks the latest upstream `pi-coding-agent` release; no Node engines change (floor stays `>=22.19.0`). Inherits SIGTERM/SIGHUP `session_shutdown` cleanup and bounded RPC stdin behavior from pi 0.77. Server `package.json::piCompatibility` and the `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` dependency both bumped from `^0.75.x` → `^0.78.0`. `bundled-node-meets-pi-floor.test.ts` lookup table extended with `0.76.0`, `0.77.0`, `0.78.0` rows (all → Node 22.19). Three Electron Docker tests (`test-electron-install.sh`, `test-deb-install.sh`, `test-desktop-launch.sh` + inner scripts) rewritten for the bundle-only flow — pre-R3 managed-dir extract, offline-cacache install, and wizard runtime-install stages removed; each now includes a pi-version-meets-`piCompatibility.minimum` check that fails fast on floor drift. (change: `bump-pi-compat-to-0-78`)
- **Pi compatibility floor lifted to 0.75.0 (recommended 0.75.5).** Users on pi 0.74.x now see the red "below minimum" bootstrap banner with an upgrade hint at 0.75.5. The dashboard's declared Node engines floor rose to `>=22.19.0` (root + server) to mirror pi 0.75.0's own breaking-change Node bump. `node-guard.ts::isAffectedNode` now refuses to start on Node `v22.18.x` (previously accepted). Bundled-extension peer-deps (`pi-anthropic-messages`, `pi-flows`) bumped to `>=0.75.0` / `^0.75.0` in lockstep — they replace the deleted `offline-packages.json` as the dashboard's pin surface. A new repo-lint `bundled-node-meets-pi-floor.test.ts` asserts the bundled Node version (`BUNDLED_NODE_VERSION` in `_node-version.sh`) meets the Node floor required by `piCompatibility.minimum`. (change: `bump-pi-compat-to-0-75`)
- **RPC keeper sidecar is now the default and only spawn path for headless RPC sessions.** Slash commands (`/ctx-stats`, `/curator`, `/agents`, `/flows:*`) now work in every dashboard-spawned headless session without configuration — typing them in the chat input dispatches through the per-session keeper UDS / named pipe and the command output renders inline. The legacy `tail -f /dev/null | pi` shell wrapper (Unix) and direct-stdin pipe (Windows) headless spawn paths are removed; the keeper is now the uniform mechanism across both platforms, bringing the "pi survives dashboard server restart" durability invariant to Windows for free. The `useRpcKeeper` config field is removed and silently ignored if present in `~/.pi/dashboard/config.json`. **BREAKING (config only)**: users who explicitly set `useRpcKeeper: false` to opt out of the keeper now get the keeper anyway — there is no opt-out flag, since the legacy spawn paths no longer exist. (change: `enable-rpc-keeper-by-default`)

### Fixed
- **`npm install -g @blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` no longer fails postinstall with `Cannot find module .../packages/server/scripts/fix-pty-permissions.cjs`.** The root `postinstall` hook now invokes the root-level `scripts/fix-pty-permissions.cjs` (the inline-twin sister of the server copy that already existed and is unit-equivalent) instead of reaching into the `packages/server/` workspace tree, and `package.json#files` now ships that root script. Some npm releases (observed on Node 26 / npm 11.17) appear to omit nested `packages/<workspace>/scripts/` directories when installing a workspace-root package globally, leaving the postinstall pointing at a missing path. Root `scripts/maybe-patch-package.cjs` already used this pattern successfully, so the fix is to mirror it. (issue: #97)
- **File references are openable everywhere they appear, and absolute references resolve to themselves.** The tool-output tokenizer now recognises absolute POSIX paths (`/Users/me/app.ts`), `file://`/`file:///` URIs (percent-decoded to a native path), and Windows drive paths (`C:\src\app.ts`) as first-class file links with their root preserved — previously the leading `/` or `file://` scheme was stripped and the path was wrongly re-rooted under the session cwd. Read/Edit/Write tool headers (`OpenFileButton`) now fall back to the in-dashboard preview overlay when no editor is detected instead of rendering nothing. Assistant prose and inline-`code` spans are now linkified (fenced code blocks are not). The preview overlay now syntax-highlights code files (matching the Read renderer) with the line-number gutter and scroll-to-line preserved. Absolute paths still pass the `/api/file` known-session-cwd containment check — an absolute path outside every session cwd is rejected. (change: `unify-file-link-openability`)
- **Sessions stuck after Stop/Shutdown now reliably terminate.** `headlessPidRegistry.killBySessionId` escalates pi from SIGTERM to SIGKILL within a 2-second grace window via the shared `killProcess` ladder (uniform with `handleForceKill`); the RPC keeper sidecar additionally SIGKILLs its `piChild` on its own `shutdown()` (defence-in-depth) so a hung pi cannot be orphaned by the keeper's exit. The legacy non-keeper branch and `cleanupOrphans` startup hygiene use the same ladder. Previously a hung pi (CPU loop, non-cancellable native call) could survive the entire kill ladder and only a dashboard server restart cleared it. (change: `fix-keeper-kill-escalation`)
- **OpenSpec task counter and stepper actions refresh within ≤ 1 s of editing `tasks.md`** (was up to ~30 s + jitter). Server now attaches a per-cwd `fs.watch` on `<cwd>/openspec/changes/` (recursive) for every known directory. Watcher fires on `tasks.md`, `proposal.md`, `design.md`, or `specs/**/*.md` events with a 300 ms debounce, then runs the existing mtime-gated poll — no bypass of dedup, concurrency cap, or broadcast suppression. Periodic 30 s poll remains as fallback for missed events (network FS, EMFILE, etc). No new config knobs. (change: `fix-openspec-taskcheck-delay`)
- **Extension slash commands (`/ctx-stats`, `/ctx-doctor`) now render their output in dashboard-spawned RPC sessions.** Previously these only showed a green "completed" pill — context-mode and similar extensions branch on `ctx.hasUI` to decide whether to call `ctx.ui.notify` or return data, and `pi --mode rpc` initialized `ctx.hasUI = false`, so the return-data branch was taken and the output was silently dropped. The bridge already proxies `ctx.ui.notify` through PromptBus to the dashboard; this change adds `ctx.hasUI = true` immediately after the proxy block in `session_start`. **Behavior change for `pi-web-access` users**: web searches in dashboard RPC sessions now default to the `"summary-review"` curator workflow (curator browser window opens). Pin `"workflow": "none"` in pi-web-access config to restore prior behavior. (change: `fix-bridge-hasui-for-headless-rpc`)

## [0.5.4] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Dynamic PWA manifest naming.** `/manifest.json` now varies by origin. Default label derives from `Host` header → `os.hostname()` → `"Pi-Dash"` fallback, formatted as `Pi-Dash · <source>`. Optional `dashboardName` config field + Settings → General → "PWA Display Name" input for user override. Distinguishes home-screen icons across multi-machine / tunnel installs. iOS Safari requires uninstall + re-add to pick up new name; Chrome/Edge/Android refresh within ~24h. (change: `add-dynamic-pwa-manifest-naming`)
- **Runtime bootstrap-install eliminated in all arms (Electron, standalone, bridge).** pi/openspec/tsx are now regular dependencies of `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-server`. Standalone `npm install -g @blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` brings them in via npm itself — no first-run install delay, no `~/.pi-dashboard/` writes, no `installable.json`, no `bootstrap_status_update` WS events. Electron ships them inside the immutable app bundle at `<resourcesPath>/server/node_modules/`; updates land via electron-updater whole-app replacement. `jiti` remains a direct dep of pi-dashboard-server; the bin wrapper resolves it from own `node_modules`. Server `cli.ts` logs `[bootstrap] ready (pi resolved via <source>)` on success and throws hard on failure. Pre-R3 modules removed: `bootstrap-state`, `bootstrap-queue`, `bootstrap-install`, `bootstrap-install-from-list`, `installable-list`, `managed-workspace-materialize`, `managed-package-whitelist`, `BootstrapBanner`, `useBootstrapStatus`, `/api/bootstrap/*`. Legacy `~/.pi-dashboard/` left untouched; `detectLegacyManagedDir()` surfaces a Doctor advisory only. The `/api/pi-core/update` path is retained for the standalone + bridge arms (where it has a writable target) and hidden under Electron via `/api/health.launchSource === "electron"`. (change: `eliminate-electron-runtime-install`)
- **Mid-turn prompt queue.** Typed-during-streaming messages now visibly queue above the input as chips (one per send), with a single "Clear all" affordance and a count badge on each session card. The bridge owns the queue per-session and drains it via `pi.sendUserMessage` on `agent_end`. The 30-second `pendingPrompt` safety timer is now queue-aware: it pauses while the prompt is observed in the queue, eliminating the false-positive *"the prompt may not have been received"* error that fired during long streaming turns. The input stays enabled while the agent is streaming so further sends accumulate naturally. Cancel actually cancels: clicking "Clear all" drops the bridge queue before pi ever sees the messages. (change: `surface-mid-turn-prompt-queue`)
- **Roles UI in Settings.** Built-in plugin `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-builtins-plugin` contributes a `settings-section` claim under Settings → General → Roles. Edit per-session role-to-model maps, save/load/delete presets. Replaces the inline roles dropdown inside ModelSelector. Existing protocol untouched (`role_set` / `role_preset_*`). Third-party plugins can contribute additional roles UI via the same slot. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)
- **Plugin staleness banner.** `/api/health` now returns `bundleHash` (sha256 of discovered plugin set). Client compares to embedded `PLUGIN_REGISTRY_HASH`. Amber banner with Refresh button surfaces when hashes differ — remote browsers / zrok clients learn when their cached bundle is out of sync. Dismiss persists in sessionStorage. No new REST route or WS message. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)
- **`/api/health.plugins[]` diagnostic fields.** Each plugin entry gains `bridgeLoadedFrom: "packages[]" | "dashboardPluginBridges" | "none"` (computed by re-reading `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`) and optional `lastProbe: { status, peers, at }` (from forwarded `flows-anthropic-bridge:status` events). One `curl /api/health` now diagnoses bridge load failures end-to-end. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)

### Changed
- **Subagent inspector now ships with `pi-dashboard-subagents` as the recommended producer.** The dashboard drops specialized support for `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` — its `Agent` tool calls now render via the generic tool renderer, and the `get_subagent_result` / `steer_subagent` specialized renderers have been removed. `pi-dashboard-subagents` is foreground-only, streams a full per-step timeline (tool calls, reasoning, assistant text), and is now bundled in the Electron installer for first-run availability. The companion `subagents-plugin` provides inline-expand and popout views for inspecting subagent runs. (change: `add-subagent-inspector`)
- **Plugin bridge registration dual-writes `packages[]`.** `registerPluginBridge` / `deregisterPluginBridge` now manage both `dashboardPluginBridges[dashboard-<id>]` (forward-compat) AND `packages[]` + a `_dashboardManagedPackages` ownership map. pi-coding-agent 0.74 ignores `dashboardPluginBridges` and only loads extensions from `packages[]`; previously this meant every bundled bridge plugin (notably `flows-anthropic-bridge`) was effectively dead. One-shot reconciliation at server start heals pre-existing installs. Env escape hatch: `PI_DASHBOARD_DISABLE_PLUGIN_BRIDGE_PACKAGES_WRITE=1`. **BREAKING** for plugin authors who relied on the old write being a no-op. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)
- **Dashboard no longer claims `/flows*` slash commands.** Flow operations surface through buttons only (`SessionFlowActions` Run/New/Edit/Delete, `FlowDashboard` Abort). pi-flows continues to register the slash commands for TUI users — no behavioral change for TUI hosts. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)
- **`useSelectedSessionId` plugin context hook.** Plugins rendering in global surfaces (e.g. `settings-section`) can now reactively scope to the currently viewed session. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end`)

### Fixed
- **Electron cold-launch probe cascade.** Four bugs broke packaged-Electron first-launch on machines without a system pi install, producing a silent splash-hang with no on-disk trace. (change: `fix-electron-cold-launch-probe-cascade`)
  - **piExtension probe always returned null.** `probePiExtension` in `packages/electron/src/lib/launch-source.ts` read `settings.extensions` — a non-existent field in pi's settings schema. Fixed: probe now walks `settings.packages[]` via new `listPiPackages(opts)` export in `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/pi-package-resolver.js`, returning `ResolvedPiPackage[]` deduped by `packageDir` across user + project scopes.
  - **`pi-dashboard --version` required jiti.** `packages/server/bin/pi-dashboard.mjs` previously resolved jiti even for `--version`, breaking version probes when managed dir was empty. Fixed: `--version` / `-v` / `version` short-circuit reads sibling `package.json` and exits 0 without resolving jiti.
  - **Launch-source diagnostics lost on `.desktop` launch.** `console.warn` / `console.error` from probes went to stderr, which packaged-Electron `.desktop` launches discard, leaving no post-mortem trail. Fixed: new `logLaunchSource()` + `appendDashboardLog()` helpers dual-write to `~/.pi/dashboard/server.log` with `[<ts>] [launch-source] ...` prefix; all 8 console-write sites routed through the helper.
  - **`extractBundle` selective-wipe silently disabled.** `buildExtractedSource` passed an `extractFs` with no-op overrides for `mkdirSync` / `readdirSync` / `rmSync` / `statSync`, so the selective-wipe step inside `extractBundle` never ran. Stale absolute symlinks under `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/.../node_modules/.bin/X` pointing back at a vanished `<resourcesPath>/server/` produced `ERR_FS_CP_EINVAL` on every cold launch. Fixed: `extractFs` shape narrowed to `Partial<ExtractFs>`, no-op overrides dropped; `buildFs` now fills real-fs defaults for destructive operations. Self-healing for any user's corrupt managed dir.
- **`@pi/anthropic-messages` 0.3.0 widens the gate.** Activation no longer requires the model id to match `/claude/i`. Any `model.api === "anthropic-messages"` session opens the gate — covers OAuth + API-key + proxy providers (9Router, custom OpenAI-compatible bases) that route to Anthropic but report non-Claude model ids. `PI_ANTHROPIC_MESSAGES_FORCE_CANONICAL` now overrides `model.api` too. `isClaudeAnthropicMessages` kept as deprecated alias for one minor. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end` Group 4)
- **pi-flows 0.2.0 abort race.** `flow-execution.ts` parallel agent batch now wraps `Promise.all` with `raceWithAbort`. Parent flow unwinds within ~10 ms of AbortSignal firing instead of waiting for every in-flight child to observe the signal at its own iteration boundary. Pending children still call `session.abort()` on themselves; cancelled results synthesized so observers (TUI, dashboard) render accurate per-agent state. Repo-lint forbids new `spawnAgent` calls without explicit `signal:`. (change: `fix-pi-flows-end-to-end` Group 3)
- **Linux x64 AppImage maker fixed.** Three bugs blocked every linux-x64 Electron release. `@pengx17/electron-forge-maker-appimage@1.2.1` called `execSync` without `stdio: 'inherit'` — `patch-apprun.sh`'s stdout (every file from `--appimage-extract` plus `wget` + `appimagetool`) overflowed Node's 1 MB default stdio buffer, throwing `spawnSync /bin/sh ENOBUFS`. Patched via `patch-package` to stream child output instead of buffering. Newer `appimagetool` builds also require `ARCH=<uname-m>` explicitly; `packages/electron/scripts/patch-appimage-fix.sh` now passes `ARCH="$SYSTEM_ARCH"` alongside `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`. Linux-x64 AppImage and DEB artifacts now publish reliably from the Release workflow.
- **Standalone `npm install` postinstall guard.** `patch-package` is wired into the root `postinstall` but it's a devDep — end-users running `npm install --omit=dev` against the published tarball had neither `patch-package` nor a `patches/` directory, producing `sh: 1: patch-package: not found` (exit 127). Fix: tiny CJS wrapper `scripts/maybe-patch-package.cjs` no-ops unless both `patches/` and a resolvable `patch-package` package.json exist; included in the published root tarball via `files[]`. Cross-platform (Linux / Windows / macOS) via `require.resolve` + `spawnSync`, no shell tooling.
- **Windows standalone-install spawn bugs (3).** `jiti` URL handling, `.cmd` `EFTYPE` on shell-less spawn, and missing `node` prefix in spawn argv all broke `npm install -g @blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` on Windows. CI gained a `standalone-install-smoke-windows` matrix leg covering Node 22/24/25 to keep regressions from hiding again. (change: `fix-windows-standalone-install-spawn-bugs`)
- **Windows System32 PATH ensurance + bundled-Node dir resolution.** Electron child-process spawns on Windows sometimes saw a `PATH` missing System32 / Wbem / WindowsApps when launched from File Explorer (`launchctl`-equivalent context), breaking `where`, `cmd /c`, and bundled-Node resolution. New shared helper `ensureWindowsSystemPath` prepends the canonical Windows system dirs when missing; resolved bundled-Node directory is now stable across launch contexts. POSIX is a no-op. (change: `fix-windows-path-system32-missing`)
- **Wizard occluded by splash on Windows first-run.** On Windows, the Electron splash window covered the welcome wizard on first launch, freezing the user behind an undismissible splash. Splash now closes before the wizard is shown; wizard receives focus and is brought to front. (change: `fix-wizard-occluded-by-splash`)
- **`node-pty` bumped to 1.2.0-beta.13.** Adds Linux prebuilds (x64 + arm64) so `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-server` no longer falls back to source-compile on Linux installs that lack a C++ toolchain. Companion jiti hygiene fixes for the bin wrapper.
- **Recovery HTTP server on missing top-level deps.** When the bundled server can't resolve a critical top-level dependency at startup, the launcher now degrades to a minimal HTTP server that serves a diagnostic page + `/api/doctor` instead of silently failing. Pi sessions are unavailable but the user can see what's wrong and reinstall. (change: `add-startup-recovery-server`)
- **CI Electron on-demand build workflow.** New `CI Electron (on-demand)` workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-electron.yml`) builds the full 6-leg Electron installer matrix (darwin arm64/x64, linux arm64/x64, win32 arm64/x64) without publishing to npm or creating a GitHub Release. Use to smoke-test packaging changes on feature branches without burning a SemVer slot. Version slug shape: `<base>-ci.<UTC-stamp>.<branch-slug>.<sha7>`, ranked below the base stable so accidental releases don't reach electron-updater clients with default `allowPrerelease: false`. (change: `add-ci-electron-on-demand-build`)

## [0.5.3] - 2026-05-11

> **Note**: 0.5.3 republishes all 0.5.2 user-visible content with working Electron installers. 0.5.2 npm packages shipped but the Electron build matrix failed across all 6 platforms because a missing root `tsx` devDependency broke the `bundle-recommended-extensions` step, so no GitHub Release / installers were produced for 0.5.2. The first `### Fixed` bullet (the tsx fix) is what made 0.5.3 possible; all other bullets originally landed under 0.5.2.

### Added
- **Honcho dashboard plugin (v0.5).** First-class in-tree plugin at `packages/honcho-plugin/` adds Honcho memory integration to the dashboard: settings panel under Settings → Memory, per-session memory subcard with map popover, docker-compose self-host lifecycle (start/stop/restart/status with health polling), aggregate model picker, and route-override dropdown. On first self-host install, the dashboard auto-mints a `pi-proxy-*` API key against its own `/v1/*` model proxy and seeds the compose stack's `llm` block so `host.docker.internal:<port>` reaches `/v1/*` out of the box (no manual key copy). Config lives at `~/.honcho/config.json` with atomic deep-merge + secret preservation. (changes: `honcho-dashboard-plugin`, follow-ups for docker-integration tests + remint key + fullscreen dialogs queued)
- **Tunnel watchdog with live-tunable settings.** Background watchdog probes the public zrok tunnel URL (`GET /api/health` through the edge) and auto-recycles the tunnel after consecutive 5xx / network / timeout failures — fixes long-lived `zrok share` subprocesses that silently stale on the edge while the local server stays healthy. Defaults: 60 s interval, 2 consecutive failures, 10 s probe timeout. Tweakable live (no restart) under Settings → General → Tunnel; status surfaced on `GET /api/tunnel-status.watchdog`.
- **Legacy `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` detection + one-click cleanup.** Pi was renamed to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` at v0.74; the old scope tops out at 0.73.x and its `bin/pi` symlink collides with the new scope (EEXIST → "no new session spawning"). The dashboard now scans three locations on startup (npm-global, `~/.npm/_npx/*`, `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules`) and surfaces an amber banner offering one-click removal via `POST /api/bootstrap/legacy-pi/cleanup`. Banner takes precedence over the upgrade-recommended hint.
- **Session card + folder header redesign.** Stacked translucent **SessionSubcards** (OpenSpec / Workspace / Process / Memory / Flows) with capsule legend titles overhanging the top border; round status dot replaced by the **source MDI icon** (TUI / Headless / tmux / Zed) colored by lifecycle state; **status-tinted capsule rail** in the left gutter with an icon chip overlay; gutter itself is the drag zone (no separate handle). Folder headers (sidebar pinned groups) follow the same gutter-plus-content pattern.
- **Linked-session pills surface lifecycle + actions in folder OpenSpec view.** Each session attached to a proposal in the sidebar now shows its source icon colored by status (with a `resuming` / `streaming` pulse), a selection border that doesn't change row height, and hide / unhide / resume / fork icons inline. Clicking the name still jumps to the session.
- **Auto-hide empty session subcards (OPENSPEC / MEMORY / FLOWS).** Subcards no longer render as empty translucent panels when their content isn't applicable — honcho not installed, cwd not an OpenSpec project, or session has no flows + no `flows:new` command. Implemented via a new optional `shouldRender?` field on `PluginClaim` (resolved at the wrapper-gate layer so absent claims don't count toward `useSlotHasClaimsForSession`) plus call-site gating for FLOWS. Side effect: `predicate` strings declared in plugin manifests (e.g. jj-plugin's `isInJjRepo`) now correctly filter contributions.
- **Slash-command punctuation aliases (`:` ↔ `-`).** The prompt expander now probes both `:`-form and `-`-form variants of a typed slash command against local prompts/skills and the `pi.getCommands()` registry, with original-form-first precedence. Skill resolutions reached through the alias path are correctly wrapped in the `<skill>` envelope, so e.g. `/opsx-archive` renders as a SkillInvocationCard even when the registered name is `opsx:archive`.
- **Dashboard model proxy: OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible LLM proxy built into the dashboard server.** Routes `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`, and `POST /v1/messages` are now served directly by the dashboard. The proxy uses the same provider configuration (`~/.pi/agent/{auth,providers,models}.json`) as connected pi sessions, but runs server-resident — no pi session needs to be open. Authentication is via dedicated proxy API keys (`pi-proxy-*`) managed in Settings → API Proxy; dashboard JWT is never accepted on `/v1/*`. Concurrency limits are configurable (`maxConcurrentStreams`, `perKeyConcurrentStreams`). An optional `secondPort` binds a second listener for clients that hardcode path-prefix-less base URLs. A recursion guard rejects custom provider `baseUrl` values that point back at the dashboard itself. Optional JSONL request logging (`modelProxy.logRequests`). Runtime-resolves `@mariozechner/pi-ai` via the existing `ToolRegistry` — no new hard dep in `package.json`. Degrades gracefully to `proxy.status: "degraded"` on `/api/health` when pi-ai is unavailable. (change: `add-dashboard-model-proxy`)
- **Plugin UI primitive registry.** Dashboard plugins now access shared React primitives (markdown rendering, agent cards, dialogs, zoom controls, format helpers) via a runtime registry instead of direct npm imports. The dashboard registers eight primitives at startup under stable string keys (`UI_PRIMITIVE_KEYS.markdownContent`, `agentCard`, `confirmDialog`, `dialogPortal`, `searchableSelectDialog`, `zoomControls`, `formatTokens`, `formatDuration`); plugins look them up via `useUiPrimitive(key)` from `@blackbelt-technology/dashboard-plugin-runtime`. Plugins ship zero React for the registered primitives — only intent (which key + what props). The slot system (plugin→shell, claims) and the registry (shell→plugin, primitives) are orthogonal mechanisms; both stay. Hooks (`useMobile`, `useZoomPan`) and Phase-2 extension-ui slot consumers (`AgentMetricSlot`, `BreadcrumbSlot`, `GateSlot`) remain direct imports — hooks can't go through a registry (Rules of Hooks) and slot consumers are a different layer. flows-plugin migrated as the first consumer; future extractions (openspec, git, subagents) will use the registry uniformly. A repo-lint test (`no-primitive-direct-import`) blocks regression. New test helper `withUiPrimitiveProvider({...})` simplifies plugin-side tests. See `docs/plugin-ui-primitives.md`. (change: `add-plugin-ui-primitive-registry`)

### Changed
- **`tsx` fully extruded from runtime and bootstrap.** The `pi-dashboard` bin entry is now `packages/server/bin/pi-dashboard.mjs` — a tiny ESM wrapper that resolves jiti from pi's tree and re-execs `node --import <jiti-url> cli.ts <args>`. No tsx fallback: when jiti is unresolvable, the wrapper exits 1 with `pi-dashboard: cannot find jiti. Install pi: 'npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent'` on stderr. The `cli.ts` shebang dropped `--import tsx` (now plain `#!/usr/bin/env node`); the in-body tsx fallback in `cmdStart` and the tsx-first branch in legacy electron `launchServer` were already removed by `unify-server-launch-ts-loader`. **Bootstrap install lists** at `cli.ts`, `server.ts`, `dependency-installer.ts`, `power-user-install.ts`, and `bootstrap-install.ts` no longer include `"tsx"` — fresh installs do not write `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/tsx`. **Doctor's Server-launch-test** rewritten: drops the `where/which tsx` probe and runs `node --import <jiti-url> -e "import <cli>..."` via `ToolResolver.resolveJiti({ anchor })`. **Devdep removed**: `tsx@^4.21.0` gone from root `package.json`; `npm ls tsx` only shows it as a transitive of `vite` (build-only, runtime-irrelevant). The zombie `packages/electron/src/lib/ts-loader-resolver.ts` was deleted by the sister change. **Net effect**: jiti is the single TS loader on every code path — runtime, bootstrap, diagnostics, packaging. (change: `replace-tsx-with-jiti`; coordinated with: `unify-server-launch-ts-loader`)
- **Single shared spawn primitive for the dashboard server (`launchDashboardServer`).** Every starter (Bridge auto-spawn, Standalone CLI `pi-dashboard start`, Electron `spawnFromSource`, legacy V1 `launchServer`) now routes through `packages/shared/src/server-launcher.ts`, which owns jiti loader resolution, `--import` argv URL-wrapping, env merge, log-file header, and the readiness poll (health-ok / port-conflict / early-exit / timeout). Loader resolution is unified into `ToolResolver.resolveJiti({ anchor?, anchorOnly? })` (managed pi → system pi → caller anchor → `process.argv[1]`; upstream `jiti` first, legacy `@mariozechner/jiti` fallback). The `restart-helper.ts` orchestrator script calls a new `buildNodeImportArgvParts` helper from `node-spawn.ts` so the `--import` argv shape lives in exactly one place. **Removed exports**: `resolveJitiImport`, `resolveJitiFromAnchor`, `pickJitiRegisterUrl`, `pickJitiFromAnchor`, `buildJitiRegisterUrl`, the `./resolve-jiti.js` package subpath, `resolveJitiFromPi` (now an internal shim), and `packages/electron/src/lib/ts-loader-resolver.ts`. **New exports**: `launchDashboardServer`, `JitiNotFoundError`, `PortConflictError`, `EarlyExitError` (from `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/server-launcher.js`). The legacy in-body tsx fallback in `cli.ts cmdStart` and the tsx branch in electron's `launchServer` are dropped — jiti is the only TS loader. Repo-lint `no-raw-node-import` allow-list tightened to exactly two files (`node-spawn.ts`, `server-launcher.ts`); zero `ban:raw-node-import-ok` markers remain. **Migration note**: downstream packagers importing from `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/resolve-jiti.js` must switch to `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/platform/binary-lookup.js` (`new ToolResolver().resolveJiti(...)`) or `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/server-launcher.js`. Per-starter end-to-end smoke coverage (Bridge / Standalone cold+warm / Electron-V2 per LaunchSource / Electron-V1 / restart) is captured separately in proposal `server-launch-smoke-suite` so it can ship on its own cadence with CI gating on `release/*` branches. (change: `unify-server-launch-ts-loader`; followup: `server-launch-smoke-suite`)
- **First-run unblocking docs corrected for macOS.** Both `README.md` (Quickstart) and the marketing site's Install tab (`site/src/components/InstallTabs.tsx`) now recommend `xattr -cr /Applications/PI-Dashboard.app` instead of `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PI Dashboard.app"`. The previous instructions had two issues: (1) the bundle is named `PI-Dashboard.app` (hyphen, matches `packagerConfig.name` in `packages/electron/forge.config.ts`), not `PI Dashboard.app` with a space; (2) `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` errors with `No such xattr: com.apple.quarantine` when the attribute is absent (e.g. locally built apps, or a previously cleared install), confusing first-time users. `xattr -cr` is idempotent — clears all extended attributes recursively, no error when nothing is set. A note now explicitly calls out the `No such xattr` message as harmless for users following older instructions.

### Fixed
- **Publish workflow: declared missing `tsx` devDependency so the bundle-recommended-extensions step resolves on CI.** Root cause of the 0.5.2 Electron build matrix failure; this fix is what makes 0.5.3 ship working installers. (change: `fix-publish-tsx-missing`)
- **Process-level crash safety net.** `cli.ts` now installs top-level `unhandledRejection` + `uncaughtException` handlers (logged with a stable `[crash-safety]` prefix, never `process.exit()`) so a misbehaving plugin (e.g. honcho's 404 from `api.honcho.dev`) cannot kill the dashboard under Node 25's fatal-by-default async-fault policy. The daemon harness still covers real signal/exit crashes.
- **Spawning a new Electron session no longer blanks the entire window.** A dangling `mdiConsoleLine` reference in `SessionCard.tsx` (post-commit `26cc9ee7`) threw `ReferenceError` on first render when a freshly spawned session's source was missing from `sourceIcons`, unmounting the whole React tree because no ErrorBoundary sat above the inner ChatView one. Fix restores the import and adds a top-level chrome `<ErrorBoundary>` around the apiProvider's children — any future render-time throw in the shell (sidebar, session list, content header, MobileShell) now degrades to a recoverable "Shell encountered an error" panel with a Reload button.
- **Light-mode pill contrast.** SessionSubcard title pills (OPENSPEC / WORKSPACE / MEMORY / FLOWS) and StatePill / JjWorkspaceBadge / HonchoBadge backgrounds were unreadable in light mode (`#aaa on #f0f0f0`). Title pills switched to `--text-tertiary` + `font-semibold`; per-state overrides added under `[data-theme="light"]` for StatePill states (PLANNING / READY / IMPLEMENTING / COMPLETE); the jj-workspace and Honcho badges gained a reactive `useIsLightTheme` MutationObserver hook with palette flips. JjWorkspaceBadge also gains a leading `mdiSourceFork` icon.
- **Extension slash commands now work in headless dashboard sessions via the new RPC keeper sidecar.** `/ctx-stats`, `/curator`, `/agents`, `/flows:*`, etc. typed in the chat input of a dashboard-spawned headless session now dispatch correctly: the server spawns a per-session `keeper.cjs` (CJS-pure, ~120 LOC) that owns pi's stdin pipe and exposes a per-session UDS (`~/.pi/dashboard/sessions/<sessionId>.rpc.sock` on Unix) or named pipe (`\\.\pipe\pi-rpc-<sessionId>` on Windows). When a slash command is typed, the bridge sends `dispatch_extension_command` to the server, which writes `{type:"prompt", message:..., id:requestId}` to the keeper UDS; pi's RPC mode runs the dispatch via `session.prompt()`. Keepers outlive dashboard server restarts (Unix already had this via the legacy `tail -f` wrapper; Windows now gains it for free as a side-effect). **Experimental — default off.** Flip in `~/.pi/dashboard/config.json` with `useRpcKeeper: true`. Tmux / Windows Terminal sessions retain the existing `command_feedback {error}` stopgap — they cannot be reached this way because the user's terminal owns pi's stdin. Activates the full Path B behavior automatically once upstream `pi.dispatchCommand` ships. (change: `add-rpc-stdin-dispatch-with-keeper-sidecar`)
- **Extension slash commands no longer silently send to the LLM.** Pi extensions registering slash commands via `pi.registerCommand` (e.g. context-mode's `/ctx-stats`, `/ctx-doctor`; pi-web-access's `/curator`, `/websearch`; pi-subagents's `/agents`; pi-flows's `/flows:new`, `/flows:edit`, `/flows:delete`, etc.) typed in the dashboard chat used to fall through to `pi.sendUserMessage`, where pi's own dispatcher is bypassed — the LLM saw the literal `/foo` text and improvised. The bridge now feature-detects `pi.dispatchCommand` (pi 0.71+) and dispatches extension commands through it, emitting `command_feedback {started, completed|error}` for visible lifecycle. On pi 0.70 (no `dispatchCommand`), a stopgap surfaces `command_feedback {status: "error"}` with a clear pi-version message instead of corrupting the conversation. Skill commands (`/skill:foo`), prompt templates, and unrecognized slashes are unaffected and continue to fall through to `sendUserMessage`. Full dispatch will activate automatically once pi 0.71+ propagates. (change: `fix-extension-slash-commands-in-dashboard`)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-11 [yanked-electron]

> npm packages were published successfully but **no GitHub Release or Electron installers were produced** — the Electron build matrix failed across all 6 platforms because a missing root `tsx` devDependency broke the `bundle-recommended-extensions` step. All user-visible changes from this version are republished under [0.5.3](#053---2026-05-11) with working installers; see that section for full notes. The 0.5.2 npm packages remain on the registry for reference but should not be installed.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Spawn correlation token: kill-fork-doesn't-kill-parent + auto-select after fork.** Server now mints a UUIDv4 `spawnToken` per `spawnPiSession()` invocation, injects it as `PI_DASHBOARD_SPAWN_TOKEN` into the spawned pi's environment, and the bridge echoes it back in the first `session_register`. The `headlessPidRegistry` exposes a three-tier link — `linkByToken` (strong identity) → `linkByPid` (works for any bridge that sends `pid`) → `linkSession` (legacy cwd-FIFO fallback) — used by `event-wiring.ts` to resolve `sessionId↔pid` mappings deterministically. The `pendingForkRegistry` is keyed by token, eliminating the race where two same-cwd forks would mis-attribute parents. `spawn-register-watchdog` adds a third `byToken` index alongside `byCwd` and `byPid`. The browser protocol gains optional `requestId` (`spawn_session`, `resume_session`) echoed in `spawn_result` / `resume_result`, plus optional `spawnRequestId` on `session_added` so the client auto-selects the new session for both spawn AND fork — closing the long-standing UX gap where forks did not auto-navigate. All new fields are optional; old bridges, old clients, and old servers continue to work via the lower-tier matching fallbacks. (change: `spawn-correlation-token`)

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Killing a forked session no longer occasionally kills its parent.** Pre-fix, `headlessPidRegistry.linkSession(sessionId, cwd)` resolved by first-unsessioned-in-cwd FIFO order, which could swap parent and fork sessionIds when the bridge connect order didn't match the dashboard's spawn order. The new three-tier link (token → pid → cwd-FIFO) makes the mapping race-free for any bridge that sends a `pid` in `session_register` (all current bridges do). (change: `spawn-correlation-token`)
- **Forking an empty session no longer hangs for 30 seconds with a generic timeout.** Previously, forking a session whose `.jsonl` had not been written yet (e.g., a freshly spawned session before any message) caused `pi --fork <missing-path>` to crash silently — the wrapper `sh -c "tail -f /dev/null | pi …"` kept the parent process alive, so spawn-detached's 300ms crash check passed and the dashboard reported `success: true`. The bridge inside the dead pi never registered, so the spawn-register watchdog took 30 seconds to fire a generic "Pi started but never connected" banner. The dashboard now performs an `existsSync` preflight before fork. When the source has no persisted JSONL, the server silently degrades to a fresh spawn in the same cwd (inheriting the parent's `attachedProposal` if any) and surfaces the substitution via `code: "FORK_DEGRADED_TO_NEW"` plus a non-blocking toast ("Started a fresh session — the source had no persisted history to fork from."). For empty sources, fork's user-meaningful semantic is identical to a new session, so honoring intent beats refusing. Both the WS handler and the `/api/session/:id/resume` REST handler share the same logic. (change: `fix-fork-empty-session-silent-timeout`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Skill invocations in chat now render as collapsible cards; ↑ recalls the slash form, not the expanded body.** When a user types `/skill:openspec-explore continue with X` (or any other skill), the dashboard's bridge now wraps the expanded skill body in pi's own `<skill name="..." location="...">body</skill>\n\nargs` envelope (byte-identical to pi's `_expandSkillCommand` output). The chat view detects this envelope and renders a distinct purple-tinted card with a wrench icon, the full slash form (`/skill:openspec-explore continue with X`) always visible in the header, and a body that's collapsed by default — click the chevron to expand the skill body and args. Four copy buttons: copy as Markdown (raw wrapper), copy as plain text (rendered body), **copy as `/skill:` command** (slash form to invoke again), and **copy as message** (just the user's typed args, hidden when the skill was invoked without args). Only the chevron icon is the expand/collapse toggle so the slash text remains mouse-selectable for native drag-copy. The chat-input ↑ history-recall now returns the slash form too, so users can re-invoke a skill without deleting thousands of characters first. The session sidebar's display name and search also see the condensed form because `firstMessage` is now condensed server-side before truncation. As a side effect, this aligns dashboard-typed skill invocations with pi-TUI's persisted format — single source of truth across both ingress paths. (change: `render-skill-invocations-collapsibly`)
- **Chat markdown now renders local-file images and LaTeX math.** Agents can reference local screenshots inline as `![alt](/abs/path.png)` or `![alt](./relative.png)`; the bridge inlines the bytes via a new streaming-safe `pi-asset:<hash>` token + side-channel `asset_register` WebSocket event so each unique image's bytes ride exactly once per session regardless of how many `message_update` chunks repeat the token. Math expressions — inline `$x = \beta$` and display `$$\sum_i^n i$$` (block-level) — are typeset via `remark-math` + `rehype-katex` with `throwOnError:false` so half-formed mid-stream expressions render as a fallback rather than crashing the markdown view. SVG, PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, and BMP are supported with caps of 5 MB per image and 20 MB of new bytes per message; oversized / unreadable / unsupported-type tokens render as a visible placeholder rather than a broken-image glyph. The dashboard server adds zero new HTTP routes — image bytes flow through the existing event stream pattern that Read-tool images already use. (change: `chat-markdown-local-images-and-math`)

### Changed
- **Provider Authentication settings now mirror the full provider list pi knows about, instead of an 8-item curated subset.** The dashboard server's hardcoded `OAUTH_PROVIDERS` and `API_KEY_PROVIDERS` arrays have been replaced by a bridge-pushed catalogue: the bridge introspects `modelRegistry.authStorage` + `modelRegistry.getProviderDisplayName` and sends a new `providers_list` message alongside the existing `models_list`. The server caches the catalogue per pi process and uses it as the source for `GET /api/provider-auth/status`. Providers like `deepseek`, `fireworks`, `cerebras`, `mistral`, `kimi-coding`, `huggingface`, `google-vertex`, `amazon-bedrock`, etc. are now manageable from Settings → Provider Authentication. The status response also surfaces `envVar` (the env var pi-ai checks, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and `ambient: true` for AWS profile / GCP ADC ambient credentials, with `maskedKey: "(ambient)"`. Extension-registered OAuth providers (added via `pi.registerProvider({oauth: ...})` from another extension) become visible automatically. No `package.json` changes; no new dependencies. (change: `replace-hardcoded-provider-lists`)

- **Windows: NSIS installer removed.** The NSIS setup wizard (`@felixrieseberg/electron-forge-maker-nsis`) is dropped. Windows distribution is now **ZIP** (`.zip`) and **portable `.exe`** (7-Zip SFX via `electron-builder --win portable` — no NSIS dependency). Users previously using the NSIS installer should extract the `.zip` to any directory and run `PI Dashboard.exe` directly. No system-level installation is required. (change: `simplify-electron-bootstrap-derived-state`)

- **Electron Bootstrap via Derived State (Phase C — `simplify-electron-bootstrap-derived-state`).**
  - Replaced `~/.pi-dashboard/mode.json` startup-flag with per-launch capability probes and `DASHBOARD_STARTER` env var.
  - Added `selectLaunchSource()` resolver — five precedence-ordered sources: `attach > devMonorepo > piExtension > npmGlobal > extracted`.
  - `DASHBOARD_STARTER` env var now stamped on every server spawn (`"Electron"` | `"Bridge"` | `"Standalone"`); exposed via `/api/health.starter`.
  - Added `pid` field to `/api/health` for lifecycle ownership; Electron stops the server only when `starter=Electron AND pid matches`.
  - Server reads `~/.pi/dashboard/installable.json` before binding; installs missing packages in bootstrap phase (no-op when file absent).
  - Added `bundle-extract.ts` — version-marker-driven `~/.pi-dashboard/` extraction with survive-extract whitelist (`node/`, `node-pending/`, `node-old/`).
  - Added `POST /api/electron/reextract` endpoint (Electron-only; 403 for other starters; 202 triggers Electron-side restart).
  - Config files (`*config*`, `mode.json`, `recommended-wizard.json`, `api-key.json`) auto-migrated to `~/.pi/dashboard/migrate/<timestamp>/` on upgrade.
  - `LAUNCH_SOURCE_V2` flag now defaults to `true`; set `LAUNCH_SOURCE_V2=false` to revert to the legacy mode.json-based flow (escape hatch only).
  - **Note**: `LAUNCH_SOURCE_V2` flag will be removed in a follow-up change after Phase C ships without regressions.

#### Migration Notes (for users upgrading from v0.4.x)

- `~/.pi-dashboard/mode.json` is no longer used; existing installs are auto-migrated on first launch.
- Config files (`*config*`, `mode.json`, `recommended-wizard.json`, `api-key.json`) are archived to `~/.pi/dashboard/migrate/<timestamp>/` on first V2 launch.
- `~/.pi-dashboard/` is now managed exclusively by the Electron app; do not manually edit files there.
- `installable.json` lives at `~/.pi/dashboard/installable.json` and controls which packages are installed.
- API key may need re-entry if it was stored in `api-key.json` (check `~/.pi/dashboard/migrate/` for recovery).
- `node/`, `node-pending/`, `node-old/` under `~/.pi-dashboard/` are preserved across Electron version upgrades.

### Fixed
- **Newly-spawned sessions no longer get their session name overwritten with a UUID-shaped string when the agent reads/writes/CLI-references a UUID-named OpenSpec change directory.** The activity detector (`packages/shared/src/openspec-activity-detector.ts`) used a permissive `[^\s"']+` capture group for change-name extraction that accepted UUIDs, mixed-case slugs, underscored slugs, and pathologically-long tokens. The previous fix (`fix-openspec-flag-rename-bug`) only rejected `-`-prefixed tokens (CLI flags) on the explicit premise that the detector is a stable single source — that premise didn't hold. Two layers of defense now: (a) the detector validates every captured token through the new `isValidOpenSpecChangeSlug` helper enforcing OpenSpec's own slug shape `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$` (lowercase, leading-letter, kebab-case, max 64 chars — mirrors `openspec new change` validation) on all three branches (Read, Write, Bash), and (b) the auto-attach branch in `packages/server/src/event-wiring.ts` re-validates `detected.changeName` against the same predicate before stamping `openspecChange`/`attachedProposal`/`name` or sending `rename_session`, so a future detector regression cannot propagate junk to disk. Manual attach paths (browser `attach_proposal`, REST `/api/session/:id/attach-proposal`) intentionally bypass the slug check and accept any user-supplied name from the server-curated change list. (change: `fix-uuid-rename-bug`)
- **Browser-rendered terminals no longer render at half-height on the folder-terminals page.** App.tsx kept a legacy keep-alive `<TerminalView>` list mounted unconditionally for the long-removed `/terminal/:id` route. Whenever the user opened `/folder/<cwd>/terminals`, that legacy list mounted a hidden `<TerminalView>` for every terminal in the global Map alongside the visible `<TerminalView>` rendered inside `<TerminalsView>` — two WebSockets per terminal id, two `AttachAddon`s writing to the same PTY, and two `FitAddon` instances racing to send `resize` messages. The hidden one (measuring a `display:none` 0×0 container) won often enough to shrink the PTY to a near-zero geometry, while the visible xterm rendered the PTY's tiny output into the top half of its viewport. The fix removes the legacy keep-alive list, the `/terminal/:id` route matcher, and the redirect effects (~50 LOC out of `App.tsx`); `<TerminalsView>` becomes the single owner of `<TerminalView>` mounting. As defense-in-depth, `terminal-manager.ts` now ignores any inbound `{type:"resize"}` control message with `cols < 2` or `rows < 2` — a PTY at those dimensions is non-functional for every supported shell and no legitimate user intent maps there. As a bundled bonus, the auto-shutdown idle timer now factors in active terminals: a long-running `cargo build` or `tail -f` in a terminal with no agent attached keeps the server alive, instead of being killed by idle-shutdown after `shutdownIdleSeconds`. **BREAKING** (theoretical): direct navigation to `/terminal/:id` now lands on the SPA catch-all (`/`); no in-tree code path used the route, no docs reference it, and folder-scoped `/folder/:encodedCwd/terminals` is the canonical entry. (change: `fix-terminal-half-height-dual-mount`)
- **Sidebar no longer leaves a running session below the “Show N ended” divider after the dashboard server restarts.** The browser used to merge incremental on-connect `session_added` + `sessions_reordered` messages into stale state from the previous server lifetime; depending on bridge-reattach timing, an actually-running session could end up rendered under the ended divider until a manual page refresh. The server now emits a single atomic `sessions_snapshot` message on every browser WebSocket connect, and the client REPLACES (does not merge) its `sessions` Map and `sessionOrderMap` from that payload, so stale ids are dropped atomically. **BREAKING** (browser protocol): older browser tabs from before this release that reconnect to a server with this change will see no sessions until refreshed; the legacy per-session bootstrap loop has been removed. Live updates after the snapshot continue to use the existing incremental messages. (change: `fix-stale-sessions-on-reconnect`)

## [0.4.6] - 2026-05-02
### Added
- **Electron Intel Mac DMG** (`darwin-x64`) is now published alongside the Apple Silicon DMG on every release. The CI matrix gained a `macos-13` row that produces `PI-Dashboard-darwin-x64-<ver>.dmg`. Fixes the long-standing "cannot be opened" error on Intel Macs trying to run an arm64-only artifact (Rosetta cannot translate arm64 → x86_64). The site's Download section now renders Apple Silicon and Intel as two equally prominent buttons. Local-builder helper `packages/electron/scripts/build-installer.sh` gained a `--mac-both` flag, sentinel-driven per-arch cache invalidation, and a Rosetta 2 preflight so maintainers can validate both DMGs on an Apple Silicon mac before cutting a release. (change: `add-darwin-x64-build`)

### Changed
- **Breaking (direct download links)**: the macOS Apple Silicon DMG is renamed from `PI-Dashboard-<ver>.dmg` to `PI-Dashboard-darwin-arm64-<ver>.dmg` for symmetry with the new Intel build (`PI-Dashboard-darwin-x64-<ver>.dmg`). External deep links pointing at the old unsuffixed filename will 404 - update them to the new naming or link to the [Releases page](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-agent-dashboard/releases) instead. (change: `add-darwin-x64-build`)

### Fixed
- **macOS DMG release-asset collision** - both macOS matrix legs (`darwin/arm64` on `macos-14`, `darwin/x64` on `macos-15-intel`) used to emit a static `PI Dashboard.dmg` basename, causing `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` to silently overwrite one arch with the other on release-asset upload (it dedups by basename). Even though the CI matrix correctly built two DMGs per release, only one ever survived in the published GitHub Release - whichever job finished last won. Intel users were hit hardest because their DMG was usually overwritten by the arm64 one and Rosetta cannot translate arm64 → x86_64. The DMG maker's `name` field is now composed at config-evaluation time as `` `PI-Dashboard-darwin-${process.arch}-${pkgVersion}` `` so each leg lands a distinct asset. **One-time release-asset URL change**: anyone scripting downloads against the unsuffixed legacy URL (`releases/download/<tag>/PI%20Dashboard.dmg`) will see a 404 starting from the next release - link to the [Releases page](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-agent-dashboard/releases) or the new `PI-Dashboard-darwin-${arch}-${version}.dmg` pattern. Locked by `forge-config-dmg-naming.test.ts`. (change: `fix-darwin-dmg-arch-collision`)
- **Tasks popover** now renders rows for every change, not just those whose `tasks.md` uses `1.1`-style numeric ids. Previously, changes authored without numeric id prefixes (e.g. `- [ ] Verify runner image`) showed `Tasks 24/36` on the button but `No tasks.` in the popover - a silent disagreement between the openspec CLI's count and the dashboard's stricter parser. The parser now accepts top-level checkboxes with or without ids, synthesizing a stable `L<line>` identifier for id-less rows that round-trips through the toggle endpoint without ever leaking into the file. The button count and popover row count are now contractually identical, locked by a new spec scenario. (change: `relax-tasks-parser-id-optional`)

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-01
### Added
- Resume / Fork pills in the desktop session content header when the viewed session is `ended` and has a `sessionFile` - no more bouncing back to the sidebar after a server reload or pi crash. Mirrors the sidebar SessionCard's visual language and reuses the same `handleResumeSession` plumbing. (change: `resume-button-in-session-header`)
- New `reattachPlacement` config field (`"preserve" | "streaming-only" | "always"`) and a Settings → Sessions dropdown that controls how the dashboard places re-registering bridges in `sessionOrder` after a restart. (change: `reattach-move-to-front`)
- New `registerReason: "spawn" | "reattach"` field on the `session_register` extension protocol message; bridges set it automatically. Legacy bridges that omit the field are treated as `"spawn"` for backwards compatibility.
- New `server_restarting { reason, quiesceMs }` extension protocol message broadcast by `/api/restart` and `/api/shutdown` before exit. Bridges that receive it suppress the auto-start spawn step in `server-auto-start.ts` for the quiesce window so they don't race the orchestrator. Discovery + reconnection still run during the window. (change: `fix-restart-bridge-auto-start-race`)

### Changed
- **Windows electron CI no longer uses MSYS/bash.** Every step in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` that can run on a Windows runner now executes via `node`, `cmd.exe` (default), or `pwsh` - zero `shell: bash` invocations on Windows. `bundle-server.sh` ported to `bundle-server.mjs` (`cp -R` → `fs.cpSync`, `find` → recursive `readdir`, `chmod` → `fs.chmodSync`); produces bit-identical output (verified parity: 2251 files). Pins `electron: "32.3.3"` (drop the caret) so `app-builder-lib`'s `getElectronVersionFromInstalled` fallback finds a regex-valid version on Windows NSIS builds (workspace hoisting puts electron at the root `node_modules/`, where electron-builder doesn't look). New repo-lint `no-bash-on-windows.test.ts` parses every workflow YAML, computes per-step Windows reachability from each step's `if:` filter, and fails when any `shell: bash` step is reachable on a Windows runner - prevents future regressions at PR-review time. (eliminate-bash-on-windows-runners)
- **Prereleases now publish safely.** Versions with a SemVer prerelease segment (e.g. `0.4.5-rc.1`) are detected by the `prepare` job's new `is_prerelease` output and routed appropriately: npm publish uses `--tag next` instead of the default `latest` (so consumers running `npm install <pkg>` keep getting the last stable release; rc consumers opt in via `npm install <pkg>@next` or `@<exact-version>`), and the GitHub Release is created with `prerelease: true` so it surfaces as such on the Releases page. Stable versions are unchanged (default `latest` dist-tag, regular Release). Pre-fix, an rc tag would have polluted the `latest` dist-tag and surfaced as a regular Release - an `npm install` of any sub-package would have grabbed the rc, breaking every consumer. Locked by three new assertions in `packages/shared/src/__tests__/publish-workflow-contract.test.ts`. (eliminate-bash-on-windows-runners)
- **BREAKING (default behavior)**: when the dashboard restarts, still-alive pi sessions now float to the **top** of their folder lists by default, instead of being preserved at their pre-restart drag-order positions. This eliminates the case where a session you were actively running before a restart ended up buried mid-list. To restore the old behavior, set `reattachPlacement: "preserve"` in `~/.pi/dashboard/config.json` and run `pi-dashboard restart`. (change: `reattach-move-to-front`)

### Fixed
- Long-lived sessions no longer accumulate massive `messages[]` duplication across reconnects. A 5-day-old session with 50 unique `toolCall` ids in `events.jsonl` was rendering as 14-16 copies of every tool card in the DOM (~700+ rows), producing a never-ending-scroll feeling because the chat container's `scrollHeight` was enormous and packed with duplicate tool runs. Three orthogonal idempotency fixes in the client reducer/handler close this: (A) `useMessageHandler::case "event_replay"` resets state on every full replay sweep, not only when `firstSeq === 1` - it also fires when `firstSeq <= maxSeq` so paginated reconnect re-replays whose first batch starts mid-stream are correctly recognised as overlapping replays. (B) `tool_execution_start` updates an existing row keyed by `toolCallId` in place instead of pushing a duplicate React key. (C) `flushStreamingTextAsAssistantRow` derives its row id from `toolCallId` (`flush-${toolCallId}`) rather than `messages.length`, so re-running the same start event finds the existing row and skips the push. Property-style tests pin `reduceEvent` idempotency for both `toolResult` and flushed-assistant rows; an integration test pins the WS handler's reset trigger across paginated, repeated, and tail-extension batch shapes. (change: `fix-replay-duplicates-tool-and-flushed-rows`)
- **Windows electron installer is usable for the first time since v0.3.0.** End-to-end smoke testing on a fresh Windows machine surfaced a chain of 3 latent runtime defects + the install-layer naming chaos. Every prior CI run was masked by either fail-fast cancelling Windows or the build itself failing earlier (path-translation bug from PR #10). All four issues land together because each fix is small and the defect chain only fully breaks when they ship together. **Naming chaos**: `productName` was `pi-dashboard-electron`, npm `name` was `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-electron`, and electron-builder's NSIS install-dir fallback strips slashes - producing `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\@blackbelt-technologypi-dashboard-electron\` install dirs and Start Menu shortcuts that targeted the non-existent `pi-dashboard-electron.exe`. The Forge NSIS maker's `getAppBuilderConfig` callback now explicitly pins `productName`, `appId`, and every `nsis.*` field to `pi-dashboard`. Pinned by `forge-config-naming.test.ts`. **Defect 1 - wizard auto-skip skipped the install**: when first-launch detected `pi.found && bridge.found`, the wizard auto-skipped its UI AND `installStandalone()`. Result: `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` stayed empty, the bundled server's TS-loader resolution fell through to the user's system pi (which on machines with `pi-coding-agent@0.71.x` ships `jiti@2.6.5` - a version that misnormalizes `file:///` URL entries on Windows), and the server child crashed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before binding. The fix decouples "show wizard UI?" from "run managed install?": the auto-skip removes the UI but ALWAYS runs `installStandalone()` (idempotent on populated dirs, fast on second launches). Decision logic extracted into the pure `decideStartupAction(state)` helper for test surface. **Defect 2 - jiti version contract**: `shouldUrlWrapEntry()`'s Windows-non-tsx arm assumes the jiti loader is from `pi-coding-agent@0.70.x` (jiti 2.x). The contract is now documented in the function's header comment (`!! JITI VERSION CONTRACT !!`) and regression-pinned by `node-spawn-jiti-contract.test.ts` which asserts `offline-packages.json` keeps the pin in `0.70.x`. Defended in practice by Defect 1's fix - once the managed dir has the pinned pi, the system-pi fallback is never reached. **Defect 3 - orphan shim ENOENT**: `detectPiDashboardCli()` picked `lines[0]` from `where pi-dashboard` output, which on Windows is the extensionless POSIX shim that npm-global ships next to the `.cmd`. `spawn()` without `shell: true` cannot invoke an extensionless shim. The new `pickSpawnableShim()` helper filters for `.cmd`/`.exe`/`.bat`/`.ps1` on `win32` and falls back to `lines[0]` only when no executable extension is found. POSIX behaviour unchanged. **Server-startup deadline + error wording**: `waitForReady` deadline bumped from 15s to 60s (gives `installStandalone()` + cold-start headroom on first launch). Error message split into cause-aware variants - "Server child process exited prematurely (...)" when `ready.error` mentions an exit, vs. "Server did not respond within 60 seconds (...)" when the deadline elapsed. Pre-fix wording said "Server failed to start within 15 seconds (child exited with code N)" even when the elapsed time was milliseconds. Pure helper `buildServerStartupError(...)` shared by both `launchViaCli` and `launchServer`. (fix-electron-windows-installer-and-server-bootstrap)

### Migration

For users with v0.4.4 installed (the broken-naming + broken-server version):

1. Open **Apps & Features** in Windows Settings.
2. Find `pi-dashboard-electron` and click **Uninstall**.
3. Manually delete `C:\Users\<you>\.pi-dashboard\node_modules\` so the v0.4.5 first-run install starts from a clean target.
4. Download the v0.4.5 `pi-dashboard-Setup-<version>.exe`.
5. Run Setup. The installer will install to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\pi-dashboard\`.
6. On first launch the splash will show "Setting up dependencies..." for ~5-15s while the offline cacache extracts into the managed dir. After that the dashboard opens normally.

No tooling required; no auto-migration from the broken install path.
- Assistant text now appears above its own tool card / `ask_user` dialog during the entire tool runtime, not just after `message_end`. Previously the streaming text bubble was rendered after `messages.map()` in ChatView, so any `toolResult` or `interactiveUi` row pushed mid-stream sat visually above the prose introducing it - invisible for fast tools but glaring for `npm test` (4-min) and `ask_user` (blocking on user response). The reducer now flushes `streamingText` into a permanent assistant row at `tool_execution_start`, with the flushed row's `entryId` stamped in place at `message_end` (preserves the `fork-entryid-accuracy` contract). Hard turn-boundary clamp on the stamp scan prevents cross-message `entryId` pollution if a prior message's `message_end` was dropped by a bridge disconnect. (change: `fix-streaming-text-vs-interactive-ui-order`)
- Dashboard restart no longer races bridge auto-start. `pi-dashboard restart` now delegates to `/api/restart` when the dashboard is up (mirroring the `cmdUpgradePi` pattern), and the `restart-helper.ts` orchestrator explicitly SIGTERM/SIGKILLs the previous PID before spawning the replacement. Symptoms fixed: agents running `pi-dashboard restart` from a chat would silently leave the server offline; clicking restart inside Electron could orphan the new server outside Electron's lifecycle supervision. (change: `fix-restart-bridge-auto-start-race`)

### Added
- **Folder OpenSpec section: clickable task counter.** The `N/M tasks` indicator on each change row in `FolderOpenSpecSection` is now a button that opens the existing `TasksPopover` with the row's cwd + change name - the same component used by session cards. No new server endpoint, no parallel toggle logic; one popover at a time, opening another row swaps the popover. Read-only progress glance becomes interactive without first attaching a session. (add-folder-task-checker-and-spawn-attach)
- **Folder OpenSpec section: spawn-with-attach.** Each change row gains a green play-icon button to spawn a new pi session in the folder's cwd with the change pre-attached, atomically. Implemented as an optional `attachProposal?: string` on `SpawnSessionBrowserMessage` (backward-compatible - old servers ignore the field, old clients omit it); the dashboard server queues the intent in `pendingAttachByCwd` (FIFO per cwd, cap 8, 60 s TTL) and consumes it on the next `session_register` for that cwd, applying the same idempotent attach + auto-rename logic as the explicit attach UI. The bare folder `+Session` button keeps the unattached semantics. (add-folder-task-checker-and-spawn-attach)

### Changed
- **Workspace package management now mirrors the global treatment.** The workspace card's Pi Resources view splits cleanly into two single-purpose tabs: **Resources** (browse-only - loose `<cwd>/.pi/{skills,extensions,prompts}` files plus per-package nested resource trees) and **Packages** (the only workspace-scope install/uninstall surface). The Packages tab renders a new "Installed Packages" section above search using the same `PackageRow` machinery as Settings → Pi Ecosystem, so npm, local-path, and git sources all get working `Update`/`Uninstall` actions - closing a long-standing gap where local-path packages had no uninstall affordance in the workspace UI. The legacy "Installed" filter pill in the search results is removed (the dedicated section replaces it), and the `MergedScopeSection` no longer renders standalone manage rows for installed packages alongside loose workspace files. The first tab is renamed from "Installed" to "Resources" to make the browse-vs-manage split self-evident. (unify-workspace-package-management)

### Fixed
- **Release CI: electron matrix no longer races `publish`.** Release run #34 (v0.4.2) failed with macOS hitting `npm error code ETARGET / No matching version found for @blackbelt-technology/dashboard-plugin-runtime@^0.4.2` while `bundle-server.sh` ran its `npm install --omit=dev` - because the `electron` matrix job declared `needs: prepare` only and started in parallel with `publish`. The bundled server's dependency on `@blackbelt-technology/dashboard-plugin-runtime` (added in commit b9fcea9 to fix `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on clean installs) is resolved from the public npm registry, so electron MUST run after publish finishes uploading. The fix gates `electron` on `needs: [prepare, publish]` and adds `strategy.fail-fast: false` so a single-OS failure no longer cancels the other four matrix variants. A new repo-lint test (`packages/shared/src/__tests__/publish-workflow-contract.test.ts`) parses `publish.yml` and asserts both invariants so a future workflow refactor cannot silently regress the contract. Wallclock cost: ~+3 min on the electron matrix per release (acceptable - alternative is half-shipped releases that need manual recovery). (publish-fix-macos)
- **Dashboard OIDC login (Google / GitHub / generic OIDC) now completes successfully in the Electron build.** The `harden-external-link-handling` change (#13) added a `will-navigate` guard that intercepts every non-same-origin top-level navigation and routes it through `shell.openExternal`. That guard's predicate was target-only - it never asked which page initiated the navigation - so once the user was redirected to the OAuth provider's login (e.g. `accounts.google.com`), every multi-step navigation Google performs internally during sign-in (form → password challenge → 2FA → consent) was preempted and bounced to the OS default browser, mid-flow. The OAuth flow could never complete in Electron under any provider that uses multi-step authentication. Fix: a new pure helper `decideWillNavigate(serverOrigin, currentUrl, targetUrl)` in `packages/electron/src/lib/link-handling.ts` reads `webContents.getURL()` at the moment `will-navigate` fires and only intercepts when the user is currently on the dashboard. Mid-flight provider-internal navigation is allowed; the eventual callback redirect back to the dashboard origin lands as a same-origin navigation and the SPA reloads the authenticated state normally. The trap-guard for the primary failure mode (external link clicked from chat content) is preserved bit-for-bit. `setWindowOpenHandler` is unchanged. (fix-oauth-blocked-by-external-link-guard)
- **Multiselect dialogs no longer auto-cancel on the dashboard.** The bridge now patches `ctx.ui.multiselect` into the same PromptBus path as select/input/confirm/editor, and the browser response encoder preserves `{values: string[]}` as a JSON answer so empty selection (`[]`) remains distinct from cancellation. The `ask_user` schema keeps its OpenAI-compatible `type: object` root while restoring Anthropic-friendly per-method `oneOf` constraints. (fix-multiselect-auto-cancel-on-dashboard) Follow-up `fix-multiselect-tui-arm-self-cancel` removed an erroneous TUI adapter arm that was auto-dismissing the dashboard dialog within 1 second because pi 0.70's RPC mode `ctx.ui.custom` is a no-op.
- **Tool cards no longer render above their own assistant text.** When an Anthropic-style assistant message ships content `[text, toolCall]` in a single message (~22% of Opus assistant messages, measured across 20 recent sessions), the chat panel previously rendered the running tool card *before* the assistant text bubble that introduces it - because `tool_execution_start` pushes the running spinner to `messages[]` immediately while the streaming text only lands at `message_end`. The reducer's `case "message_end"` arm now runs a pure suffix-reorder helper (`reorderToolCardsForAssistantMessage`) that walks the assistant message's `content[]` in order and relocates the trailing rows to match: `text` → the just-pushed assistant bubble, `toolCall` → the `toolResult` row matched by `toolCallId`, `thinking` → the corresponding thinking bubble. The fix is API-agnostic (works for anthropic-messages, google-generative-ai, openai-completions, openai-responses; reads only the normalized content array) and order-faithful (a hypothetical `[toolCall, text]` model would render tool-then-text rather than being silently flipped). The reducer continues to push the running tool spinner immediately on `tool_execution_start` so the live UX is unchanged; the reorder happens a few hundred ms later when `message_end` lands, with React keyed reconciliation preserving the spinner DOM node. Replay path inherits the fix for free since it routes through the same reducer. (fix-text-tool-render-order)
- **Interactive UI dialogs (e.g. `ask_user`) now render below their own assistant text.** Extends the previous fix: when a `[text, toolCall:ask_user]` assistant message landed both a `toolResult` row and an `interactiveUi` row before `message_end`, the suffix-reorder helper sized its window to `relevant.length` (text + toolCall + thinking only), so the `interactiveUi` row pinned the assistant text below the dialog. ChatView's `findActiveInteractiveToolResultIds` then hid the running tool card, leaving the visible order `[ui-X, assistant-text]` - dialog above its own intro. The reducer now uses a turn-boundary anchored window (stops at `user`/`turnSeparator`/`commandFeedback`/`rawEvent` rows) and pairs each `interactiveUi` row with its parent `toolResult` via a new `metadata.toolCallId` carried on the `prompt_request` envelope. Bridge wrappers (`ctx.ui.{select, input, confirm, editor}`) now thread `toolCallId` through `opts` for tool-bound prompts; free-floating prompts (architect mode, slash commands) leave the field undefined and the reducer treats them as trailing-unclaimed, exactly where they sit today. Forward/backward compatible at the protocol level - old bridges keep today's ordering until upgraded. (fix-interactive-ui-reorder)
- **Just-killed sessions now land at the top of the ended tier.** When a user clicks ✕ (or pi exits naturally / is force-killed) on an alive session whose `startedAt` is older than other ended sessions in the same folder, the resulting card used to drop into the ended bucket sorted by `startedAt` desc - which placed it mid-bucket among other 14 h-old ended sessions, invisible to the user who just acted on it. The client now sorts the ended bucket by `(endedAt ?? startedAt)` descending so the most-recently-ended card surfaces at the top regardless of cause. Symmetrically, the server's user-intent resume branch now calls `sessionOrderManager.moveToFront(cwd, id)` instead of `insert-if-absent`, so repeated `end → resume → end → resume` cycles always land the just-resumed card at index 0 of the alive tier. Bridge auto-reattach on dashboard reboot is unchanged - it remains gated by `pendingResumeIntents` and never mutates the order. No protocol changes; the existing `sessions_reordered` broadcast carries the new order. (top-of-tier-on-status-change)
- **Desktop session-header back arrow now always lands somewhere visible.** Three closely related bugs are fixed: (1) cold loads / hard refreshes / deep links / post-server-switch state where browser history has only one entry no longer turn the back click into a silent `window.history.back()` no-op; (2) clicking a sidebar OpenSpec artifact letter, README link, or pi resource link while on `/settings` or `/tunnel-setup` no longer opens the overlay invisibly behind the JSX gate - the URL-route view auto-closes (navigate to `/`) before the overlay is set; (3) when multiple content-area overlays are simultaneously set, each back click peels exactly one in priority order until reaching the landing page. The desktop back-arrow now dispatches through a new `useDesktopBack` hook backed by a pure `selectDesktopBackTarget` helper that mirrors the priority chain mobile's inline `onBack` switch already uses, pinned by a 256-combination parity test. Mobile is untouched. (fix-desktop-back-navigation)
- **Local-path package installs no longer orphan their spinner.** The client package queue (`packages/client/src/lib/package-queue.ts`) was matching `package_operation_complete` strictly by `operationId`, but the WebSocket frame can arrive before `fetch()` resolves the HTTP response that carries the id (consistently for fast local-path installs that have no network round-trip; intermittently for small/cached npm packages). The completion was silently dropped, the spinner stuck on "Installing...", and the single-flight queue jammed for every subsequent operation until page reload. The new `matchesRunning(opId, source)` predicate falls back to `source` matching while `running.operationId` is still `null`, then prefers `operationId` once the HTTP response sets it. The same fix applies to `package_progress`. Three new tests in `package-queue.test.ts` lock down the reverse arrival order. (fix-local-path-install-spinner)
- ChatView: fixed a race during multi-batch `event_replay` that caused uncached session switches to land mid-conversation with the floating scroll-to-bottom button visible. `handleScroll` now ignores onScroll measurements that follow our own programmatic `scrollTo` for a ~150 ms window, so growing `scrollHeight` between batches no longer flips `isNearBottom` to false. (fix-chat-scroll-race-during-replay)
- Mobile session header and session card now show a read-only `📎 <change>` chip when an OpenSpec proposal is attached - previously the attached state was hidden behind the paperclip popover. The auto-rename rule on attach/detach is now idempotent across all three code paths (browser WS handler, REST endpoint, and the auto-detect activity branch in `event-wiring.ts`): detach reverts the name only when it was auto-set, and re-attach to a different change re-tracks the new name without overwriting user customisations. **Release-test reminder**: run the 6-step manual mobile QA matrix from `openspec/changes/fix-mobile-attach-proposal-display/tasks.md §6` before next release. (fix-mobile-attach-proposal-display)
- **External links in chat content no longer strand the dashboard view.** Clicking a URL emitted by the agent (or any other markdown-rendered link) used to navigate the dashboard's only window to the external page in Electron and installed PWAs - neither shell has a URL bar or a back button, so users had to force-quit or reload to recover (reported as #13). External links now open in your real system browser (Electron) or a new tab (browser / PWA). Same-origin navigation (e.g. the `/auth/login?return=...` redirect) is untouched. Two defense-in-depth layers: `MarkdownContent` renders external `<a>` with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and the Electron shell registers `setWindowOpenHandler` + `will-navigate` guards that route any remaining external URL through `shell.openExternal`. A repo-level lint prevents future client code from slipping bare external anchors in. See change: `harden-external-link-handling`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **Build-time tool registry coverage for `electron` and `node-pty`.** Both packages are now registered in the dashboard's `ToolRegistry` (`override` → `bare-import` → optional `managed` strategy chain), and a new shell-callable resolver wrapper at `packages/shared/bin/pi-dashboard-resolve-tool.cjs` exposes registry resolution to CI workflows and Dockerfiles without requiring the shared package's TS build. CI's linux/arm64 electron rebuild step (`publish.yml`) and the cross-platform Docker electron rebuild step (`Dockerfile.build`) both now go through the wrapper, so npm workspace hoisting changes can no longer break releases (this was the root cause of the v0.4.0 release crisis). See change: `register-build-time-tools`.

### Changed
- **Root postinstall (`scripts/fix-pty-permissions.cjs`) is now hoist-aware.** Replaces the hardcoded `node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds` path with `require.resolve("node-pty/package.json")`, mirroring the registry's `bare-import` strategy. Previously failed silently on every fresh install of the root workspace, leaving `node-pty`'s `spawn-helper` without execute permission and producing `posix_spawnp failed` at terminal-spawn time. See change: `register-build-time-tools`.

### Fixed
- **Per-message Fork (⤘) now includes the clicked message in the new session.** Previously, clicking the per-message Fork button on either a user or assistant chat bubble produced a forked session whose history ended one entry BEFORE the bubble that was clicked. Root cause: pi 0.69+ awaits extension handlers BEFORE running `sessionManager.appendMessage`, so the bridge's `queueMicrotask`-based deferral resolved inside the awaited dispatcher and read the *previous* leaf via `getLeafId()`. The dashboard pins `pi >= 0.70.0`, so this affected every supported pi version. Fix: bridge now (1) stamps a `nonce` on `message_start`/`message_end` events instead of relying on `getLeafId()` for live emissions, (2) defers the `message_end` send via `setTimeout(0)` (macrotask) so pi has time to mutate `event.message.id` in place and the wrapped `appendMessage` to record the id, (3) emits a new `entry_persisted { entryId, nonce }` event after each successful append so the client reducer can back-fill the user-message bubble's `entryId`. The fork pipeline (`createBranchedSessionFile` + `pi --fork`) is unchanged - once the entry id is correct, it works. Tests: `packages/extension/src/__tests__/bridge-entry-id-pi-070.test.ts`, `packages/server/src/__tests__/fork-jsonl-roundtrip.test.ts`, `packages/shared/src/__tests__/state-replay-entry-id.test.ts`. See change: `fix-per-message-fork`.
- **New repo-level lint test prevents reintroduction of hardcoded `node_modules/<dep>` paths.** `packages/shared/src/__tests__/no-hardcoded-node-modules-paths.test.ts` scans the migrated build-time files for `node_modules/electron` and `node_modules/node-pty` substrings and fails `npm test` with a `file:line:col` citation. Mirrors the existing `no-direct-process-kill.test.ts` / `no-raw-node-import.test.ts` lint pattern. See change: `register-build-time-tools`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Per-session chat input drafts + bash-style history recall.** In-progress chat text is now preserved per session when you navigate away from the chat view (Settings, OpenSpec previews, file diffs, pi-resources) and survives across dashboard reloads via `localStorage`. Switching sessions cleanly isolates drafts so text no longer leaks from one session into another. Within a session, `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` walks your previously sent prompts (newest first, consecutive duplicates collapsed) - press `Escape` mid-history to restore your in-progress draft. See change: `chat-input-draft-and-history`.
- **Hot-reload for custom LLM providers + "Test" button.** Adding, editing, or removing a provider in **Settings → Providers** now takes effect immediately across every running pi session - no reload needed. The new **Test** button sends a probe request to the configured endpoint and surfaces HTTP status + response preview so misconfigured keys / URLs are obvious before you try to chat. Previously the bridge only read `providers.json` once at startup, so new providers stayed invisible until a full session restart. See change: `hot-reload-custom-providers`.
- **Single-dashboard-per-HOME advisory lock.** Two `pi-dashboard` processes sharing the same `HOME` directory would race on `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, `.meta.json` files, PID registries, and Zrok tunnel reservations - occasionally corrupting state or SIGTERM-ing each other's child processes. A new per-HOME advisory lock detects a running sibling and hands off cleanly (via discovery + attach) instead of starting a second conflicting instance. See change: `single-dashboard-per-home`.

### Changed
- **Dashboard `/reload` now works for headless pi sessions.** Previously the bridge extension could only trigger `session.reload()` after a human had invoked `/__dashboard_reload` once in pi's TUI - making it unreachable on headless-spawned sessions. The dashboard now kills the old process and respawns it with `pi --session <file>`, producing the same observable effect (same `sessionId`, same entries) without requiring TUI interaction. `npm run reload` and the dashboard reload button now work uniformly across TUI and headless sessions. See change: `headless-reload-via-respawn`.

### Fixed
- **Trusted-network dashboard access works again without OAuth configured.** After the earlier `consolidate-trusted-networks` change repointed the Settings UI from `config.trustedNetworks` to `config.auth.bypassHosts`, users without an OAuth provider lost remote LAN access: entries added via the UI were silently dropped on save, hand-written entries were ignored at load, and the WebSocket upgrade guard kept blocking even after a save succeeded. Three bugs fixed together (UI-save persistence, config-load gate, runtime guard refresh) so adding a trusted network via the Settings UI now takes effect immediately without a server restart or an OAuth provider. See change: `fix-trusted-networks-no-oauth`.

### Performance
- **OpenSpec polling no longer pegs every CPU core every 30 seconds.** Polling across many pinned directories previously spawned dozens of `openspec` child processes simultaneously (one per change, per directory, per tick) - producing ~10-second 100% CPU bursts on workstations with many active changes. Polling now uses per-directory `mtime`-gated change detection (skips unchanged trees entirely), a shared concurrency semaphore (max N parallel spawns across all directories), and deterministic per-directory jitter to spread the work. Configurable via new `openspec.*` keys in `~/.pi/dashboard/config.json` (`pollIntervalSeconds`, `maxConcurrentSpawns`, `changeDetection`, `jitterSeconds`). Zero functional change; same poll results, orders-of-magnitude less CPU. See change: `optimize-openspec-poll-burst`.

### Fixed
- **`pi-dashboard start` and auto-start no longer crash with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` when the dashboard source lives on a non-C: Windows drive** (e.g. `B:\Dev\pi-agent-dashboard`). Previously the `fix-windows-server-parity` change wrapped only the `--import <loader>` argument as a `file://` URL; the entry-script argument (`<cli.ts>` position) was still passed as a raw Windows path. Node's ESM loader parses both positions as URLs, and its drive-letter heuristic has gaps on `A:`, `B:`, and other less-common drive letters, causing Node to interpret the drive letter as a URL scheme (e.g. `b:`) and reject it. All four server-spawn call sites (`packages/server/src/cli.ts`, `packages/extension/src/server-launcher.ts`, `packages/electron/src/lib/server-lifecycle.ts`, `packages/server/src/restart-helper.ts`) now route through a new `spawnNodeScript` helper / `toFileUrl` wrapper in `packages/shared/src/platform/node-spawn.ts` that URL-wraps both the loader and entry positions unconditionally. A repo-level lint test (`no-raw-node-import.test.ts`) prevents future spawn sites from regressing. See change: `fix-windows-entry-script-url`.
- **Custom-provider models now register with accurate `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`, `reasoning`, and `cost`** sourced from pi's model registry via `modelRegistry.find()` (captured from `ctx.modelRegistry` at the first `session_start` event). Previously every discovered model was hardcoded to 200k context / 16k maxTokens / no reasoning / `$0` cost - silently wrong for every proxied frontier model. E.g., `proxy/cc/claude-opus-4-7` now correctly reports its 1M context window instead of 200k, surfaces the thinking-level UI (reasoning capable), and tracks cost against Anthropic's Opus 4.7 pricing. Common proxy prefixes (`cc/`, `anthropic/`, `openrouter/openai/...`) are stripped before lookup so prefixed ids resolve to the same registry entry as the bare id. When the registry is unreachable or has no match, api-appropriate fallbacks apply (`anthropic-messages` → 200k/64k, `google-generative-ai` → 1M/65k, `openai-completions` → 128k/16k) - all keeping `input: ["text","image"]` so the image-capable-by-default behavior is preserved. The `session_start` handler also re-invokes `pi.setModel(refreshed)` for the currently-selected model after re-registration, so pi's internal `supportsThinking()` check sees `reasoning: true` instead of the pre-enrichment snapshot. Zero new dependencies; zero `providers.json` schema changes; zero impact on built-in / OAuth providers. See change: `enrich-custom-provider-model-metadata`.
- **Thinking level selector stays in sync across UI surfaces.** Previously clicking a thinking level in the bottom StatusBar updated the session card but not the StatusBar itself (which snapped back to `off`), because the server's `session_updated` broadcast only patched the `sessions` Map while the StatusBar reads `sessionStates[id].thinkingLevel` first. The client-side `session_updated` handler now mirrors `thinkingLevel` / `model` fields into `sessionStates` as well, so both surfaces update together. See change: `enrich-custom-provider-model-metadata`.

### Changed
- **Custom-provider models discovered via `~/.pi/agent/providers.json` now advertise image input capability by default**, so pasted images reach the upstream model instead of being stripped client-side by pi-ai's `downgradeUnsupportedImages`. Vision-capable models (Claude Opus 4.x, GPT-4o, Gemini 2+, OpenRouter multimodals) handle images correctly out of the box. Modern text-only models (GLM, MiniMax, etc.) return a polite "no image visible" reply; legacy text-only models (gpt-3.5-turbo, vanilla gpt-4) surface the upstream 400 error. Built-in / OAuth providers are unchanged - their capabilities still come from pi-ai's `models.generated.js`. See change: `enable-image-input-custom-providers`.

### Added
- **Auto-install pi on first `pi-dashboard` run** (degraded-mode first-run).
  When the server starts and `ToolRegistry.resolve("pi")` fails, it now flips
  `bootstrapState` to `installing`, runs a background `bootstrapInstall` into
  `~/.pi-dashboard/` (extracted from the Electron installer into the shared
  `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/bootstrap-install.js` module),
  auto-registers the bridge extension on completion, and flips state back to
  `ready`. The UI renders a new `BootstrapBanner` above the main layout
  (`Installing pi...` while in progress, `pi install failed - [Retry]` on error,
  upgrade hints when the resolved pi version is below the compatibility
  range declared in `packages/server/package.json` `piCompatibility`). New
  `pi-dashboard upgrade-pi` subcommand upgrades `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
  via the same shared installer, delegating to a running dashboard when
  present. Session spawn is queued during installs via the new
  `bootstrap-queue` (runs once status flips to `ready`); `/api/pi-core/*`,
  `/api/pi-resources`, and `POST /api/bootstrap/upgrade-pi` all 503/202 as
  appropriate. Extension is shipped as a runtime dep of
  `pi-dashboard-server` so `findBundledExtension` resolves it via
  `require.resolve` when installed via `npm i -g pi-dashboard`. See change:
  `unified-bootstrap-install`.

- **Bootstrap resolution harness** - in-memory (memfs-backed) test harness
  for the dashboard's bootstrap resolution: `ToolRegistry` strategy chains
  + bridge-extension registration across install mechanics, platforms, and
  HOME/path drift. Fail-closed scenario cube (3 platforms × 5 dash-locations
  × 6 pi-states × 4 settings-states × 3 env-states = 1080 cells) enforces
  that every new combination is either tested or explicitly skipped with a
  reason. Captures the current Windows `npm i -g pi-dashboard` bug (B1) as a
  trail snapshot so the fix in `unified-bootstrap-install` will flip visibly.
  Run via `npm run test:bootstrap`. No runtime behavior change; purely a
  regression-prevention layer. Prerequisites: `StrategyDeps` gains
  `resolveModule(id, from)` injector, `managed-paths.ts` exports
  `getManagedDir`/`getManagedBin` getters alongside existing constants,
  `ToolRegistry` accepts an optional `PlatformEnv` context,
  `registerBridgeExtension` accepts `{ homedir }` override - all
  backwards-compatible. See change: `bootstrap-resolution-harness`.

- **Offline first-run install for the Electron app** (opt-in). Release Electron builds now bundle a per-platform npm cacache containing pinned versions of `pi-coding-agent`, `openspec`, and `tsx` (plus all transitive dependencies) inside `resources/offline-packages/` - ~50 MB gzipped per installer. On first launch, the wizard extracts the tarball to `~/.pi-dashboard/.offline-cache/`, verifies its SHA-256 against the embedded manifest, runs ONE `npm install --offline`, then deletes the cache to reclaim ~140 MB. No network access is required. On SHA-256 mismatch or any cache-install failure the wizard aborts - there is **no silent fallback to `registry.npmjs.org`** (deterministic offline contract). When the bundle is absent (dev builds, opt-in flag off) the previous per-package registry install flow runs unchanged. New Doctor row "Offline packages bundle" shows target platform, pinned versions, and SHA-256 prefix. Gated on `BUNDLE_OFFLINE_PACKAGES=1` in CI; pins live in `packages/electron/offline-packages.json`. See change: `electron-offline-bundled-packages`.
- **Bundled first-party extensions in the Electron installer** (opt-in). A new `BUNDLED_EXTENSION_IDS` manifest in `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared` drives a build-time bundler (`packages/electron/scripts/bundle-recommended-extensions.sh`, gated by `BUNDLE_RECOMMENDED_EXTENSIONS=1`) that clones each listed extension into `packages/electron/resources/bundled-extensions/<id>/` with SPDX-license and 15 MB size-budget enforcement. At first launch, `installBundledExtensions()` copies each bundled tree into pi's git cache (`~/.pi/agent/git/<host>/<path>/`), runs `npm install --omit=dev` if needed, and registers the original git URL in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` so pi's later `update()` can re-resolve upstream. The wizard renders distinct "Bundled ✓" / "Installed" badges. Release CI (`publish.yml`) runs the bundler before `bundle-server.sh` on macOS, Linux, and Windows runners and emits a per-platform size breakdown to the workflow summary. First-party scope: currently `pi-anthropic-messages` (and `pi-flows` once its repo adds a SPDX-conformant license). See change: `bundle-first-party-extensions`.
- **Windows cross-platform parity** - fresh-install dashboard now
  starts and runs correctly on Windows 10/11. Adds `netstat`/`taskkill`
  equivalents for every Unix-only `lsof`/`kill` path: `cli.ts`,
  `/api/restart`, `pi-dashboard stop`, terminal X button, tunnel
  cleanup, and headless-session tree-kill all route through shared
  `platform/process` helpers that select the correct per-OS strategy.
- **`packages/shared/src/platform/` primitive module** - single source
  for cross-OS behavior. `binary-lookup` (`where`/`which` + `.cmd`
  extension + login-shell fallback), `process` (findPortHolders,
  killProcess, killPidWithGroup, isProcessAlive), `process-scan`
  (pgrep vs tasklist), `shell` (COMSPEC vs SHELL), `commands`
  (openBrowser, isVirtualMachine), `paths` (OS-aware normalization +
  multi-drive invariants), `exec`/`runner` (subprocess execution with
  `windowsHide:true` baked in). Every helper takes optional
  `platform: NodeJS.Platform` injection so tests exercise both branches
  without mutating `process.platform`. Enforced by three lint-style
  tests: `no-direct-child-process`, `no-direct-process-kill`,
  `no-direct-platform-branch`.
- **`ToolRegistry` binary + module resolution** - single-source resolver
  for every external binary/module (pi, pi-coding-agent, openspec, npm,
  node, tsx, git, zrok, pi-dashboard). Ordered strategy chain per tool
  (override → bare-import → managed → npm-global → where), per-resolution
  diagnostic trail, in-memory cache, override-aware. REST API at
  `/api/tools*` with a new **Settings → Tools** section for inspecting
  resolution trails, setting overrides, and exporting diagnostics.
- **Node version preflight (`node-guard`)** - server refuses to start
  on Node versions affected by nodejs/node#58515
  (v22.0-v22.17 + v24.1-v24.2) with a clear upgrade message. Bumps
  `engines.node` to `>=22.18.0`.
- **Bridge extension polish** - server-readiness wait now blocks
  indefinitely with child-exit detection (no arbitrary timeout); launch
  progress renders via `pi-tui` Loader widget; spawn failures surface
  as `spawn_error` browser messages with the log path.
- **WSL-tmux probe cache** - per-server-lifetime cache eliminates the
  per-spawn cost of detecting the WSL tmux wrapper.

### Changed
- **Electron doctor/dependency-detector** migrated to `ToolRegistry`
  (drops direct `where`/`which` shelling out). `loadPiPackageManager()`
  now delegates module resolution to `ToolRegistry.resolveModule`.
- **PathPicker** uses OS-aware separator (`withTrailingSep`) and
  `parsePathInput` so Windows drive-letters (`B:`) are handled as
  drive roots, not cwd-relative paths.
- **`spawnDetached`** gained an explicit `detach?: boolean` option
  (default `true`). pi-session spawns now pass `detach:false` so the
  child is tied to the parent's libuv Job Object - no cmd.exe console
  flash on Windows and the child terminates when the parent exits.
- **`useWindowsRedirect` gate** tightened to require
  `stdinMode === "ignore"`; libuv only honors `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` when
  every stdio handle is ignored, and a piped stdin would otherwise
  allocate a visible console.

### Fixed
- **`npm install @blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` now works in a
  fresh environment.** The 0.3.0 release on npm was unresolvable: the root
  tarball declared three workspace sub-packages as `dependencies`
  (`pi-dashboard-extension`, `pi-dashboard-server`, `pi-dashboard-web`), but
  those packages were never published to the registry because
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` ran `npm publish` without `--workspaces`.
  Any clean-environment `npm install` - including `pi install
  npm:@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` - failed with E404 on the
  sub-dependencies. This release publishes the complete runtime package set
  (`root`, `-shared`, `-extension`, `-server`, `-web`) in lockstep, with
  inter-package dependency specifiers synchronised to the current version
  by a new `scripts/sync-versions.js` helper that runs between the version
  bump and the publish step. `packages/electron` remains `"private": true`
  and continues to ship as native installers (DMG/DEB/AppImage/EXE)
  attached to the GitHub Release, not via npm.
- **Bridge auto-registration path math** was off by one - fresh
  installs silently failed to register the dashboard bridge in pi's
  `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` because `baseDir` resolved to
  `<repo>/packages/` instead of `<repo>/`. Fix uses three `..` instead
  of two; adds success/failure log lines so future regressions surface
  loudly.
- **Extension server CLI resolution** in installed npm layouts -
  `resolveServerCliPath()` used sibling-path arithmetic that produced
  `@blackbelt-technology/server/src/cli.ts` (missing the
  `-dashboard-server` suffix) in the installed tree. Now uses
  `require.resolve('@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-server/...')`
  which works in both monorepo and installed layouts.
- **Client directory resolution** in installed layouts - the server
  returned "No client build found" on installed packages because
  `clientSearchPaths[0]` used nested-`node_modules` arithmetic.
  Prepended a `require.resolve` path that works regardless of hoist.
- **Terminal X button on Windows** - now routes kill through
  `taskkill /F /T` with fallback cleanup so the whole process tree
  terminates.
- **Zrok scavenge on Unix** - `scavengeOrphanZrokProcesses` now kills
  the full process group (negative PID) so zrok's worker children
  die with it; Windows path unchanged (taskkill `/T` already tree-kills).
- **node-pty permissions in bundles** - hoist-aware permissions fix
  lands on all packaged Electron bundles (DMG / AppImage / NSIS).

### Deprecated
- **Direct `node:child_process` imports and `process.kill` calls**
  outside the `platform/` module are now architecturally forbidden
  (enforced by lint-style tests). Migrate to
  `@blackbelt-technology/pi-dashboard-shared/platform/exec` and
  `.../platform/process` respectively, or mark legitimate opt-outs
  with `// ban:child_process-ok` / `// platform-branch-ok`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **LandingPage onboarding** - empty-state main pane renders three
  guided steps (1 Setup credentials → 2 Add folder → 3 Start session)
  with live state; each step collapses to a compact ✔ row once
  satisfied so returning users see a status strip rather than a wall
  of onboarding. Credentials detection consults both `/api/providers`
  (baseUrl + apiKey config) and `/api/provider-auth/status` (pi OAuth
  / auth.json), so OAuth-only setups count.
- **OpenSpec session-card lifecycle UI** - the attached-change row
  now shows an explicit `ChangeState` pill (PLANNING / READY /
  IMPLEMENTING / COMPLETE), a `Tasks N/M` button that opens a popover
  for toggling individual `tasks.md` checkboxes (with
  optimistic-concurrency line tokens), and an overflow `⋯` menu with
  **Archive anyway** for when artifacts are authored but
  manual-verification tasks remain unchecked. Bulk Archive moved to
  unattached sessions only.
- **Recommended extensions** - new *Packages* tab surfaces a curated
  set of pi extensions (`pi-anthropic-messages`, `pi-subagents`,
  `pi-flows`, `pi-web-access`, `pi-agent-browser`) with
  install/uninstall actions and live npm/GitHub enrichment. Missing
  *required* extensions trigger a top-of-page banner. The first-run
  wizard gained a matching step with already-installed entries greyed
  out.
- **Pi core version checker + updater** - header badge counts
  available updates for pi ecosystem core packages (pi, pi-dashboard,
  pi-model-proxy, ...). A *Packages* settings section lists current →
  latest with per-package and "Update All" actions, live progress,
  and automatic session reload on success.
- **`ask_user` batch method** - new `{method: "batch", title,
  questions: [...]}` shape asks multiple related questions in one
  dialog; sequential execution via existing `ctx.ui.*` primitives,
  mid-batch cancellation returns partial results with
  `cancelled: true`. Forgiving argument coercion handles common LLM
  drift shapes (stringified `questions`, `input_type` wrapper
  flattening, `{label, value}` options, `header` / `question` →
  `title`). Backward compatible - existing single-method shapes
  unchanged.
- **Image paste in the OpenSpec explore dialog** - drop or paste
  screenshots directly into the explore prompt, matching the main
  command input (shared `useImagePaste` hook and `ImagePreviewStrip`
  component).
- **Error banner** - long LLM errors collapse to a summary line with
  *Retry* and *Copy* buttons; full detail expands on demand.
- **Model selector** - provider filter and multi-token typeahead
  search in the model picker; the same `ModelSelector` component now
  drives the default-model setting in *Settings*.
- **Anthropic payload transform extension** for the main session,
  delegating the transform to the shared `@pi/anthropic-messages`
  package.
- **Persistent editor PID registry** - spawned `code-server`
  processes are recorded to `~/.pi/dashboard/editor-pids.json`. On
  server boot, orphans from prior non-graceful exits (SIGKILL, crash,
  OOM, force-quit) are detected via cmdline ownership check and
  terminated (SIGTERM → 1 s grace → SIGKILL), freeing their bound
  port and `--user-data-dir` lockfile so next-click editor spawns
  don't collide.
- **Public marketing site** at `/site` (Astro + Tailwind + MDX +
  Preact), deployed to GitHub Pages via
  `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml` with a 50 KB gzipped JS budget
  enforced in CI.
- **Cross-platform QA VMs** - new `qa/` Packer-based harness for
  Ubuntu / Windows / macOS base images plus clone → boot → test →
  destroy lifecycle scripts (`make build-*`, `make test-*`,
  `make manual-*`) to verify clean-state installation and runtime
  across platforms from a single command.

### Changed
- **Provider auth flow** - saving credentials now broadcasts
  `credentials_updated` to all sessions, refreshes the model
  registry, and pushes updated models to every connected client; the
  model selector updates in place with no manual reload. The OAuth
  device flow replaced its auto-popup with an explicit button so the
  browser no longer blocks it.
- **Path picker** - directory filtering moved server-side via a new
  `q` query param on `GET /api/browse` with 4-tier ranking
  (exact > prefix > word-boundary > substring), applied *before* the
  200-entry cap so best matches always survive. Client input is
  debounced with in-flight cancellation. Enter follows a strict state
  machine (exact > unique prefix > highlighted row), and a new
  `POST /api/browse/mkdir` endpoint creates folders inline.
- **Bundle size + HTTP compression** - web client is manually split
  into vendor chunks (React, markdown, syntax-highlighter,
  git-diff-view, xterm, dnd-kit, utilities), dropping the main chunk
  from 3.1 MB to ~570 KB (~150 KB gzipped). Fastify now compresses
  responses through `@fastify/compress` (gzip + deflate, 1 KB
  threshold); Brotli is intentionally disabled because the zrok free
  proxy stream-resets `content-encoding: br` responses under parallel
  browser load.
- **Sidebar brand mark** - the literal `π` glyph is replaced by an
  inline-SVG `PiLogo` component (`fill="currentColor"`, transparent
  background) that inherits theme colors. Applied to both
  `SessionList` (desktop) and `SessionSidebar` (alternate).
- **"Working" session indicator** - cards in the working state now
  render an animated diagonal barber-pole stripe alongside the
  existing opacity pulse, making working vs. waiting-on-user
  unambiguous at a glance. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the
  animation but keeps the static stripes as a state cue.
- **Pin-folder button** - now reads `📌 Add folder` (tooltip: "Pin a
  folder to the sidebar") instead of the icon-only `📌+`.
- **Folder action bar** - removed the deprecated *+Terminal*
  quick-create button; use the *Terminals* tab instead.
- **File search** - replaced the `fd` binary dependency with a
  native Node.js directory walk, removing a platform-specific binary
  and simplifying Windows / portable packaging.

### Fixed
- **Test suite green baseline + jsdom unhandled errors** - restored a zero-failure `npm test` baseline (38 failing tests → 0; 2143 passed, 8 documented `.skip`s carrying `TODO(fix-failing-tests-followup)` markers). Fixes span assertion drift (auto-attach, PiResourcesView, SessionList, config, SessionCard), environment drift (git `master` → `main`, `os.homedir()` browse fixtures), component selectors (PinDirectoryDialog), and timing-flake skips in auto-shutdown / ws-ping-pong / session-lifecycle-logging. Also eliminated three vitest unhandled errors caused by jsdom gaps: `CommandInput` now optional-calls `scrollIntoView?.()`, and `QrCodeDialog` wraps `QRCode.toCanvas(...)` in `Promise.resolve(...).catch(...)` so headless-canvas rejections and `vi.fn()` mocks returning `undefined` no longer surface as "Errors 3".
- **Electron terminal spawn on macOS** - `node-pty`'s `spawn-helper` binary was shipped without execute permission in Electron bundles (npm hoisting skipped the postinstall fix), causing silent `posix_spawnp failed` errors. Added three-layer defense: build-time `chmod +x` + quarantine removal in `bundle-server.sh`, and a runtime permission fix in `createTerminalManager()` as fallback.
- **Zrok tunnel reliability** - eliminated stale
  `https://<token>.share.zrok.io` URLs returning 404 or "bad
  gateway!" caused by reservation leaks across restarts.
  `createTunnel()` is now serialized (concurrent calls share one
  in-flight promise), so UI double-clicks and the startup-auto /
  `/api/tunnel-connect` race no longer spawn parallel `zrok share`
  processes. The reserved-share retry is capped at 1 attempt and
  explicitly releases the old token before reserving a new one; the
  timeout path escalates SIGTERM → SIGKILL after a 2 s grace and
  releases just-in-time-reserved tokens; `POST /api/restart` and
  `POST /api/shutdown` now call `deleteTunnel(config.port)` before
  exit instead of bypassing the graceful-shutdown path; and an
  orphan-process scavenger sweeps any stray
  `zrok share ... --override-endpoint http://localhost:<port>` agents
  that escaped pid-file tracking (runs on startup whenever the zrok
  binary is present, even in `--no-tunnel` mode).
- **Browser `ERR_ABORTED 500` on every asset over a zrok tunnel URL**
  - Vite emits `<script type="module" crossorigin>`, which forces
  browsers to request assets in CORS mode even same-origin; the
  server's CORS callback threw on unknown origins and
  `@fastify/cors` surfaced that as HTTP 500. The active tunnel URL
  and any `*.share.zrok.io` host are now auto-allowed, and unknown
  origins return `cb(null, false)` (no CORS headers, no 500) instead
  of throwing. Pre-compressed (`.gz`) sibling files are also now
  generated at build time and served by `@fastify/static` with
  stable `Content-Length` headers, avoiding streaming-compression
  edge cases in intermediate HTTP/2 proxies. (curl kept working
  throughout because it never sent an `Origin` header.)
- **Portable Windows + packaging** - `pi-coding-agent` is now
  resolved from the managed install under
  `~/.pi-dashboard/node_modules/` instead of expecting a system
  install, so portable zips work out of the box. The `node-pty`
  permissions fix is now hoist-aware (works regardless of which
  workspace triggered `npm install`).
- **Prompt templates** - resolved from global skills and installed
  packages in addition to the local project; template names are
  split on any whitespace so multi-line arguments work.
- **Packages UI freshness** - installed-packages list auto-refreshes
  after install / remove / update operations (no more stale counts);
  server now broadcasts `pi_core_update_complete` so the header
  badge refetches and clears.
- **Session fork + replay rendering** - leaf registry fix so forked
  sessions resolve their parent `entryId` correctly; assistant text
  in replay / fork messages now renders instead of showing an empty
  separator.
- **Terminal UX** - new terminal tabs auto-focus when created and
  the UI navigates to the folder view.
- **Miscellaneous** - Roles edit from the dashboard works again;
  `ask_user` argument validation rejects malformed payloads instead
  of silently misbehaving; the browser gateway logs handler errors
  instead of swallowing them.

### Docs
- README updated with Electron standalone install instructions,
  monorepo paths, and new feature callouts.
- OpenSpec proposals added for the dashboard-ux-fixes batch and the
  explore-dialog image-paste change.

## [0.2.0 - 0.2.9] - 2026-04-13 - 2026-04-16

*Initial public releases - installer and cross-platform CI hardening.*

These versions were primarily focused on getting CI to reliably produce
installers across macOS, Linux, and Windows (including arm64). The only
user-visible items worth calling out:

- npm package renamed to `@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard` to match
  the GitHub repository (v0.2.1).
- Windows release artifacts now include a ZIP and a portable `.exe` in
  addition to the NSIS installer (v0.2.3).
- arm64 release artifacts added for Linux and Windows (v0.2.6).
- AppImage builds now work on Linux thanks to `libfuse2` in the CI image
  (v0.2.0).
- Docker cross-platform build pipeline added for producing Linux + Windows
  installers from macOS (v0.2.5).

For per-commit detail, see the Git history
(`git log v0.2.0..v0.2.9`).
